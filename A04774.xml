            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>O</hi> Bleſſed God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, whoſe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercie to me hath been ſo infinite, that nothing in earth, which I enjoy, is worthy enough to be offered unto thee: yet becauſe thou haſt ſo plentifully rewarded the widow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta, for ſharing that little which ſhe had, unto the Prophet; and haſt promiſed even the kingdome of heaven to them, who in thy name give a cup of water, of cold water; and haſt moſt graciouſly accepted the pooreſt oblations, both of the goats hair toward thy Tabernacle, and the widows two mites into the treaſurie; receive (I moſt humbly beſeech thee) the free-will-offering of my heart, and weak endeavours of my hand, in this intended ſervice: and as thou didſt fill Bezale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and Aholiab with an excellent ſpirit of wiſdome and ſubtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, to finde out all curious works, to the beautifying of thy Tabernacle: ſo I moſt meekly deſire thee, to enlighten my ſoul, to elevate my dull underſtanding; that I may ſearch for ſuch ſecret things as may be found, and finde ſuch things as may be ſearched for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and modeſtly; and that I may, like Joſhuahs good ſpies, acquaint my ſelf and others with the deſert wayes, and the ſeverall tracts and paths, which our ſouls, immediately after death, muſt travell and paſſe over, toward the Celeſtiall Canaan. O God, my good God, grant me to accompliſh this, through the ſafe conduct of Him, who is the faithfull Guide, the onely Way, the Light, and Joy of my ſoul, my Lord and Saviour JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST. So be it, moſt gracious Redeemer, So be it.</p>

                  </gap>, terrible and horrible viſions; of affrighting fire in one place; of fire in the faſhion of a flaming ſword in an other place; of dreadfull ſhapes of beaſts otherwhere; as Theodoret, and after him and from him, Procopius Gazaeus do fancie: but indeed there were true Angels, <hi>or Cherubims; and a flaming ſword which turned every way,</hi> Geneſ. 3.24. More then one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6913:14"/>Angel, and more then two (I know not how many) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many ſwords; every Angel having at leaſt one ſword, a two-edged ſword (as ſome will have it) which they brandiſhed and flouriſhed with, to the terrour of our ſinfull parents.

It is true, that awhile after Chriſts reſurrection the Jewiſh rites continued; for the Synagogue was to be brought honourably to her grave; and at Jeruſalem eſpecially, S. James adviſed S. Paul to obſerve the Ceremonial Law: yea <hi>there were fifteen Biſhops of Jeruſalem after Chriſts time; who all ſucceſsively were of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and one Mark was the firſt uncircumciſed Biſhop in the time of Adrian, after the deſtruction both of the Temple and Citie,</hi> ſaith
<note n="*" place="margin">Niceph. lib. 3. cap. 25.</note> Nicephorus. But in other places it was otherwiſe: for though S. Paul did circumciſe Timothie, <hi>becauſe of the Jews which were in thoſe quarters,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 16.3.</note> (which he might well do, by reaſon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Timothie was a Jeweſſe) yet Titus,
<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>being a Greek, was not compelled to be circumciſed,</hi> no though he was at Jeruſalem. Yea S. Paul telleth the Gentiles, with great majeſtie and ſolemnitie,
<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> Secondly, the things appointed by GOD have been redeemed, as the firſt-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.20. and tithes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.31. and theſe being inſtituted by GOD to one end, were by their redemption purchaſed to other uſes; yet made they no gain, but redeemed them at a dearer rate: ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.16. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.31. Thirdly, ſome other things appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by GOD have been diſpenſed withall. Thus circumciſion, while the Iſraelites travelled in the wildernes, and awhile after, was omitted above fourtie yeares, and again reſumed into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 5.2. Thus the Paſſeover, by one that was not clean, or was in his journey, might be forborn, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.13. To this third kinde and ſort of things by GOD appointed, do I reduce this in my text. This appointed death is not wholly abrogated, it is not redeemed; and yet ſometimes it hath been, ſometimes it ſhall be diſpenſed withall (of which hereafter) and yet for

                  </gap>, <hi>judicium,</hi> judgement. Judgement is taken two wayes; firſt, for the aſſenting or diſſenting of the intellect; in this ſenſe we ſay, <hi>I like or like not ſuch a mans judgement:</hi> ſo judgement is taken for ones opinion, perſwaſion, or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Text is not meant of judgement in this ſenſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is uſed for an act of juſtice, giving to every man what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to him. Thus is it here taken. An act of juſtice not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from man, but from GOD, and terminated upon man. The judgements of GOD upon man are manifold, both in this preſent life, and in the life to come. The judgement here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is the judgement after death. And of judgements after death there are two,
<list>
                     <item>Private of ſouls,</item>
                     <item>Publick of bodies and ſouls.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Whether of theſe two judgements is to be underſtood, we hope to finde out, when we have conſidered the laſt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the words in a lump together, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 That there are two judgements after this life, we take it here for granted; but by GODS aſſiſtance it ſhall be, in a fitter place of this diſcourſe, demonſtrated at large. But whether the generall judgement of ſouls and bodies be eſpecially here meant, or the private and particular judgement of ſouls, or both of them, is the queſtion now, and muſt be determined by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Oecumenius is for the firſt way, and wittily interprets theſe words; as if it had been ſaid, <hi>When all and every one which ever were in the world, are dead; then followeth, after the univerſall death, univerſall judgement.</hi> To him aſſenteth
<note n="*" place="margin">Bell. de Purgat lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> Bellarmine, and the book of Eſdras long before either of them,
<note n="*" place="margin">2. Eſdr. 14.35.</note> 
                  <hi>After death ſhall the judgement come, when we ſhall live again, &amp;c.</hi> where the generall judgement is pointed at, and not the particular. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6913:17"/>from hence S. Paul may be thought to have borrowed the words. I anſwer, that the Apoſtle had them not from that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; for <hi>there is neither Greek, nor Hebrew copie of that book of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Bell. de Verbo Dei, lib. 1. cap. 20.</note> ſaith Bellarmine, from S. Hierome: onely it is preſerved in Latine, and <hi>no Councel ever held it as canonicall,</hi> ſaith Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Again, I can finde no paſſage of either of theſe books of Eſdras cited in the New Teſtament; though out of other apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall books there be divers things taken. And though Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe cited the ſecond book of Eſdras (commonly called <hi>the fourth book of Eſdras)</hi> in his book <hi>de Bono mortis,</hi> and in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book on. Luke, and in his ſecond epiſtle to Horatianus; yea, though
<note n="*" place="margin">Sixt. Sen Bib. Sanct. lib. 1.</note> Sixtus Senenſis ſaith of Ambroſe, that Ambroſe thought Eſdras wrote this book by divine revelation, and that S. Paul did follow Eſdras in thoſe things which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diverſitie of order of glory, of brightnes in the elect when they ſhall be raiſed: yet Sixtus Senenſis himſelf eſteemeth not the book to be either canonicall, or deutero-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, but meerely apocryphall: and <hi>in it,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>are

                  <hi>that all ſouls are kept in certain hidden floores or chambers in hell, till the generall judgement.</hi> Sixtus Senenſis addeth, that S.

Paul would never take a teſtimony from that book, which hath ſuch palpable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, and is not extant in Greek or Hebrew. Moreover it hath no place vouchſafed in Arias Montanus his Interlineary Bible: nor doth Emanuel Sa comment on any word of it: and Bellarmine himſelf marvelleth why Genebrard would have it held canonicall. Eſtius ſaith,

                  <hi>That book hath no authoritie in the Church.</hi> But I return to the firſt expoſition.</p>
               <p>The generall judgement may be meant, and is involved; I will not deny it. Yet theſe reaſons perſwade me, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular judgement is not excluded. Firſt, if the Apoſtle had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it onely of the generall judgement, it is likely he would, as he doth in other places, have uſed fitteſt expreſſions, and terms properly advancing to that ſenſe: as thus, <hi>At the ſecond coming of Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>At the end of the world,</hi> or, <hi>When the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible hath put on incorruption,</hi> or, <hi>After the reſurrection cometh judgement.</hi> But, ſince it is written, <hi>It is appointed for men to die, and after that cometh judgement;</hi> to interpret it onely of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall judgement, is, in my opinion, to leave a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a great gulf</hi> between death and judgement: which <hi>hiatus</hi> will hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6913:18"/>be filled up, if there be reference to the particular judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what if I ſay, that the words do denote rather the not paſſing of judgement while we live, and the beginning of it to be ſhortly after death, excluding judgement in this life, and placing death rather before judgement, then any great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt death and judgement? according to the native uſe of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of which before.</p>

                  <hi>Every one ſhall be judged after death according to their own deſervings. Which words do point at the particular judgement,</hi> ſaith Suarez. Laſtly, leſt I may ſeem too eager againſt the ſecond book of Eſdras, let me borrow a teſtimony or two from thence. 2 Eſdr. 9.11, 12. <hi>They that loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my law, while they had yet libertie and place of repentance open unto them, muſt know it after death by pain.</hi> And 2. Eſdr. 7.56. <hi>While we lived and committed ſinne, we conſidered not that we ſhould</hi> BEGIN <hi>to ſuffer for it</hi> AFTER DEATH. Whence we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably collect, That the beginning of puniſhment is immediately after death, upon the particular judgement; and the increaſe or additament at the generall judgement. 2 That ſome are in torments before the generall day of retribution. 3 That the beginning to ſuffer, is not after a long time, (GOD onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how long) but after death, yea preſently after it. All theſe proofs on each ſide make way for the third and beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, That the Apoſtle meaneth not onely either of theſe judgements, but both of them. Benedictus Juſtinian on theſe words, thus,
<note n="*" place="margin">Poſt eujuſque obitum, ſequitur judicium pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatum, in quo quiſque ſuarum actionum red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit urus eſtrationem: poſt finem mundi erit judicium omnium, tum hominum tum daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> 
                  <hi>After every ones death private judgement follows, in which every one is to give an account of his actions: after the end of the world ſhall be the judgement of all, both men and devils. Of both the Apoſtle may be underſtood,</hi> ſaith he. So alſo Salmeron, and Hugo Cardinalis, and Carthuſianus. Oecolampadius thus,
<note n="*" place="margin">Sive ſpeciale judicium intelligas, ſive generale, uihil refert.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether you underſtand the ſpeciall judgement, or the gener all, it matters not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I brought you back to the point where I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: That this text is fitted to my intentions, affording me juſt liberty to write whatſoever may be conceived or expreſſed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6913:18"/>concerning the eſtate of humane ſouls in their animation or in death, or after it in the life future; becauſe the words muſt be expounded of both judgements. And now the text being clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ambiguities, the termes explained, the ſtate being made firm and ſure, not rolling and changeable; and being fixed upon its baſis and foundation, three queſtions do ſeem to ariſe from the firſt words of the text, and each of them to crave its anſwer, before I come to my main intendment.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How and when Death came to be appointed for us?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether Adam and his children, all and every one without priviledge or exception, muſt and ſhall die? <hi>It is appointed for men to die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether they that were raiſed up from the dead at any time, did die the ſecond time? <hi>It is appointed to men once to die.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the full anſwering of the firſt queſtion, how or why Death was appointed for us, I ſhall need to cleare but theſe two points;
<q>
                     <list>
                        <item>That Adam for ſinne was appointed to die.</item>

               <p>Thus ſinne was the mother of death, thus we were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die, becauſe of ſinne. As a preparative to the firſt of theſe two points, I hold it fit to demonſtrate, that Adam at firſt was made an immortall creature.</p>
               <p>Concerning Adams ſoul, and the ſpirits of all men deſcended from him, that they are immortall, I hope to prove it ſo ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an other part of this tractate, that I will fear no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof but this, that I bring too much proof for it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſing, or rather borrowing that truth (which by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6913:19"/>GODS grace ſhall be repayed with intereſt) I now come to ſhew that Adams bodie was created immortall.</p>
               <p>Immortall I ſay, not as GOD is immortall, who neither had beginning, nor ſhall have end; with whom is no ſhadow of change, much leſſe any reall, ſubſtantiall change; who hath, as all other good things elſe, ſo, immortalitie eminently; and ſo eminently, that our Apoſtle in ſome ſort excludeth all others, and appropriateth it to him, ſaying, 1. Tim. 6.16. GOD <hi>onely hath immortalitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was the body of Adam immortall, as the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpirits, and ſouls of men, which had a beginning, but ſhall have no end: Nor immortall, as the counſels of GOD, which had no beginning, but ſhall have an end.</p>
               <p>His bodie was not eternal, but eviternal, or immortall; not abſolutely immortall, but conditionally: it ſhould never have taſted death, if he had not firſt taſted of the forbidden fruit. Immortall, not as if it could not die, but becauſe it might and could have lived ever. He had not <hi>non poſſe mori,</hi> and ſo he was mortall; he had <hi>poſſe non mori,</hi> and ſo was immortall. As <hi>mortall</hi> is taken for <hi>earthly, animall,</hi> and contra-diſtinct to <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi> ſo his bodie was mortall and terrene, not ſpirituall or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall: As he could not poſſibly die, unleſſe he had ſinned, his very bodie was immortall.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6913:20"/>he maketh the body to be eternall, till the ſerpent, by his ſinne, prevailed againſt Adam; and aſcribeth a ſecond kinde of immortality to the body, becauſe ſome of the firſt ages lived ſo long a time, as about, or above 900 yeares.</p>
               <p>Even they who ſay Adams body was mortall, agree in ſenſe with me. They diſtinguiſh thus, <hi>It is one thing to be mortall, and another thing to be ſubject to death.</hi> If they grant to us, that he was not obnoxious to death, and could not die without finne, I will not be offended much, though they ſay he was mortall. <hi>As this our fleſh, which now we have, is not therefore not to be wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no neceſsitie that it ſhould be wounded: ſo the fleſh of Adam in paradiſe was not therefore not mortall, becauſe there was no neceſsitie that it ſhould die,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De peccat. Meritis &amp; Remiſ l. 1. c. 3.</note> ſaith Auguſtine. So that this is but a meer logomachy. They who call him <hi>mortall</hi> expound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that he could not <hi>mori,</hi> unleſſe he had ſinned; and I mean no more, when I ſay he was <hi>immortall;</hi> that is, he could not have died in the ſtate of innocencie: without a precedent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion he could not have been ſubject or obnoxius to death. They ſay, though he ſhould not have died, yet he was mortall: I ſay, he was therefore onely immortall, becauſe in that bleſſed eſtate he could not die. Whether of theſe two contraries, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> or <hi>Immortall,</hi> do beſt fit Adam before he ſinned, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge.</p>
               <p>As bodies are compounded of contrarieties, they are ſubject to diſſolution; to the evidencing whereof, let me recount what Holcot ſaith on Wiſedome 12.22. upon theſe words, <hi>We ſhould look for mercy.</hi>

And becauſe he did ſcorn to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Philoſophers in love to Ariſtotle, Holcot himſelf ſecondeth their prayers, thus,

               <p>From whence the commenting queſtioniſt examineth, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ariſtotle would have been in an high degree the great champion of the Chriſtian faith, if he had lived after Chriſts time.

<note n="*" place="margin">Cum conatu hominum.</note> with mens endeavour; grace diſtilling on man, according as he well uſeth the talent of nature.</hi> But at the end of that book, the Expoſitor ſtrikes all dead in theſe words,

                  <hi>Concluding fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and with truth, I ſay, that Ariſtotle (who heartily implored the mercy of</hi> GOD, <hi>praying,</hi>

Whereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth that Ariſtotle was

               </p>

               <p>And without juſt offence to Ariſtotles Lycaeum, I hope I may ſay, though Jofrancus Offuſius, that great Mathematician, in his preface to Maximilian, which is before his book <hi>Of the divine power of ſtarres,</hi> ſaith, that Ariſtotle was <hi>the High-prieſt of Philoſophers,</hi> yea

               <p>Auguſtine thus, <hi>Therefore I was willing to treat of this point with the Platonicks, becauſe their books are better known.

<note n="*" place="margin">Ariſtoteles in nos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calcitravit, ut in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem pulli.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle hath kicked againſt us, as colts againſt their damme;</hi> yet others deny that he taught publickly in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes life-time. Vives little remembreth, that the precedent words of S. Auguſtine may incline to the contrarie; beſides other authorities, aſwell as Laërtius. Secondly, that Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine his term <hi>haereſis,</hi> in the Greek, is but <hi>ſecta</hi> in the Latine; yet, by Vives his leave, S. Auguſtine could &amp; would have ſaid <hi>Congregâſſet in ſuum Lycaeum, in ſuam ſcholam, partem, ſectam, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplinam,</hi> or any otherſuch word, rather then <hi>in ſuam haereſim,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Auguſtine had intended to lay ſome aſperſion upon Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by the word of <hi>haereſis,</hi> which is homonymous. Thirdly, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves reporteth, without his authour, that Plato ſhould ſay of his two diſciples, Xenocrates and Ariſtotle, that the former needed the ſpurre, and Ariſtotle the bridle: whereas Cicero in his third book <hi>De Oratore</hi> aſcribeth the ſaying to Iſocrates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning two of his diſciples, Theopompus and Ephorus; <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus the dull, Theopompus the witty and apprehenſive:</hi> more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Suidas ſaith, it was ſpoken of Theopompus Chius, not Theopompus Gnidius. Again, Vives is miſtaken in taxing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6913:22"/>Plotinus for obſcuritie,
<note n="*" place="margin">Nè degeneraret à more ſectae.</note> 
                  <hi>leſt he ſhould degenerate from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the ſect.</hi> Whereby he would inſinuate, that either Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to was obſcure, or Plotinus, an Ariſtotelian: when S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine accounteth Plotinus among the famous Platonicks, in the ſame place; which Suidas alſo confirmeth. For Plotinus his diſciples were the great Origen, and Porphyrius, and divers other famous Platonicks; and as all the Platonicks did Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorize, ſo did all the Fathers Platonize; and Plato was in that high eſteem, that it was an ancient Proverb,
<note n="*" place="margin">Jovem, Graecè loqui ſi vellet, non aliter lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuturum quìm Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> 
                  <hi>That if Jupiter would ſpeak Greek, he would ſpeak no otherwiſe then Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I return from the compariſon of Plato with Ariſtotle, and from the oſcitancy of Vives to the old matter.</p>
               <p>Strong deluſions rightly befall them, who make Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy equall to Divinity, and aſcribe aſmuch authoritie to Ariſtotle as to Moſes or the Prophets, or to any Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, and who do anſwer their Texts with equall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

               <p>I proceed from the Philoſophicall axiome, <hi>That no Body compounded of contraries can perpetually endure</hi> (which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken onely of the decayed eſtate, beyond which Philoſophers could not aſpire, and not of the ſtate of integritie, which is our <hi>Quaere;</hi> and I come to a paſſage of Divinitie tending that way.

(therefore he was out of it ere he was put into it) &amp; after Adam ſinned, <hi>God ſent Adam forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground,</hi> or that ground, <hi>from whence he was taken,</hi> Geneſ. 3.23. (therefore the ground from whence he was taken, was a different ground from Eden, from whence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6913:22"/>he was expelled; and ſo Adam was not molded or framed of the earth or duſt of Paradiſe. All this being granted, I ſay, God could frame as laſting and as good a body, and as durable againſt the force of contrarietie, of the duſt out of Paradiſe, as of the duſt of the Garden. And queſtionles Adam was made of the earth before it was curſed, and why not then equall to the earth of Paradiſe? So that my Poſition is not yet ſhaken, <hi>The contrarie diſpoſition of the elements had not forced diſſolution, but Adam had an immortall body.</hi> Which that you may the rather beleeve, let me confirm it by reaſon and authoritie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt reaſon is this; Death cometh not but by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward violence, or inward diſtemper: in which regard, Death is divided by Ariſtotle into theſe two branches, <hi>Violent,
<note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. <hi>de vita &amp; morte.</hi>
                     </note> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> But Adam ſhould not have been ſubject to externall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall force, or dyſcraſie, if he had not ſinned: Therefore he had a bodie that, during innocency, was immortall, and not ſubject to death. The Aſſumption is onely queſtionable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former member of it, I evidence it thus: Before Man was created, the dominion over the Creatures was reſerved for him, and fore-promiſed Geneſ. 1.26. ſo ſoon as he was created, the dominion was aſsigned over to him, verſe. 28. And if no beaſt hurt Noah, or his familie in the Ark (though everie Creature imitated Adam, and rebelled againſt him their Lord, as he did againſt his Lord God) much leſſe could they have hurt Adam perſevering in innocencie. During which eſtate, the lambe and the wolf, the lion and the dragon would not have hurt one another: much leſſe would they have hurt Man: leaſt of all, would the iſſue of Adam have done him violence, or have ſaid as the wicked in the Goſpell, <hi>This is the heir, let us kill him, and divide the inheritance,</hi> Matt. 21.38. For, then there had been no diſtinction of <hi>Lord, Heir,</hi> and <hi>Servant,</hi> nor ſtrife for inheritances.</p>
               <p>It is too too true, that the higher bodies and the heavenly powers do now, beſides their ordinarie influences, ſometimes dart down among us hurtfull and noxious qualities, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſicknes and deſtruction; ſo that in divers Regions have been <hi>Epidemical &amp; popular diſeaſes: which in the great conjunction of Planets falleth out,</hi> ſaith Prolemee, Alcabitius, with other Aſtronomers. But then the heavens ſhould have dropped plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; poured down health, and no bane-full qualitie could have deſcended from them. As for lightning and thunder, and the now-right-ayming thunderbolts, the armies of Gods wrath and meſſengers of death, either there ſhould have been none (the aire then needing no purifying) or at leaſt not hurtfull or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if Satan could have uſed outward violence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed Adam or his poſteritie that way; perhaps he would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6913:23"/>never have brought in Death by the back-doore of ſinne, and never have undermined him by ſuch hidden baits, and lurking temptations.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, inward diſtemper he had none, nor could have: and thus it appeareth;</p>
               <p>There is a twofold temperature,

               </p>
               <p>The firſt may be called <hi>temperamentum ad pondus,</hi> which is <hi>proportion Arithmetica,</hi> when all the foure qualities are equally weighed and tempered: ſo that there is no predominancie, no ſuperioritie, nor can be; but all parts are equipondiall and even.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is termed <hi>temperamentum ad juſtitiam,</hi> which is <hi>Geometrica proportio,</hi> when the foure qualities hang unevenly in the balance, yet fitted to the beſt ſervice and uſe of the body. Whether of theſe two tempers was in Adam, I will not define; But if there were in his bodie <hi>difforme temperamentum,</hi> it was ſo perfect, yea equal in in equalitie, as was fit for ſuch a bodie, as might be fit for ſuch a ſoul: &amp; ſuch was the mixture of humours, by the divine hand of God compounding them, that both he and we ſhould have lived, in the flower of youth, for ever, if Adam had not offended. What the bodilie conſtitution of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was, may be thought to be the ſame or the like of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam: to whom the Pſalmiſt ſingeth, Pſal. 45.2. <hi>Pulchruiſti prae filijs hominum, Thou art fairer then the children of men: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchruiſti,</hi> as Vatablus rendereth it: which can not be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly underſtood of Solomon, as of Chriſt: who not onely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabounded in all vertues, (and <hi>vertue is fairer then the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-ſtarre,</hi> ſaith Ariſtotle) but alſo in all comely proportion, and bodilie beautie.

                  <hi>Then the children of men: why not then the Angels? What means he by ſaying, Then the children of men, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a man?</hi> as S.

Thirdly, I may expound all paſſages ſeeming to vilifie Chriſts bodily ſhape, onely compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, with reference unto his divinitie; thus the bodily beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Chriſt is not to be nam'd, or to ſtand in competition with the Deitie.

               <p>Beſides Adam his excellent temper, conſider his food; he had all the trees of the garden for meat, except the forbidden one. The healthie waters about Paradiſe he had for drink: Wholſome things he knew from hurtfull (if any hurtfull things were:) His giving them names doth prove, that he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their natures. As for taking too much or too little, it could not be, whileſt his ſoul was innocent and ſpotleſſe. For he had originall juſtice, which in the uſe of lawfull meats ſhould ſubject his ſenſes and his appetite unto reaſon. As for clothing, he needed it not: Innocency apparelled him, till he put off the robe of righteouſnes; and ſo it ſhould have continued. Laſtly, as Adam in Paradiſe had a deep ſleep which fell upon him, Geneſ. 2.21. which, I confeſſe, was extraordinarie; ſo Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,
<note place="margin">Aug. De Civ. t. 14.16. Tertul. De Anima. cap. 24.</note> Tertullian, and the School after them, do yeeld, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſleep was not excluded out of Paradiſe; but in the night he was allowed ſleep. So that Adam enjoying all things neceſſarie, delightfull, or convenient, which concerned his bodie, we may ſafely conclude the firſt reaſon, That ſince neither outward force, nor inward diſtemper could befall Adams body, if he had continued in innocencie, his body ſhould never have taſted of death; and ſo was, and ſo ſhould have been immortall. And this will yet more plainly appeare, if we will weigh the reaſons following.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Among the trees of the garden there was the tree of life, which Adam had libertie freely to eat of.</p>
               <p>Some think it was appointed as a means to tranſlate Adam to immortalitie without ſicknes or death. Others ſay, it would hinder the loſſe of naturall heat and radicall moiſture: whereby though yeares or age, yet weaknes, or de crepitnes ſhould not come nigh him. Others ſay, that it being once taſted ſhould bring perfect immortalitie, even ſuch immortalitie as we ſhould have after the Reſur rection. See Bellarmine <hi>de Gratia primi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> cap. 28. and Mr. Salkeld in his Treatiſe <hi>of Paradiſe,</hi> where in ſome whole Chapters he hath laboriouſly collected, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly explained the various opinions concerning the tree of life. Take my gleanings after their full vintage, and taſte what I have gathered.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:6913:24"/>
               <p>Though Lumbard, Sent. 2. Diſt. 29. Lit. F. queſtioneth, Whether Adam before his ſinne did eat of the tree of life, and out of Auguſtine concludeth there, That they did eat; as it was commanded, that they ſhould eat of every tree, fave one: yet I can no way agree with him. This his errour is grounded on an other, which he hath cited Diſtinct. 9. of the ſame book, in the letters B and C, That Adam was commanded to eat of the tree of life; and that he ſhould have ſinned, if he had not uſed it. For firſt, It was not a command, but a permiſſion. God gave the uſe of the tree no otherwiſe to man, Geneſ. 1.29. then to the beaſts and fowls the green herbs, verſe 21: but this was by way of indulgence, not of command. Secondly, Geneſ. 2.16. <hi>Of every tree of the garden thou may'ſt freely eat.</hi> And though it be in the Hebrew, <hi>Eating thou ſhalt eat,</hi> yet it implieth no abſolute precept. Thirdly, Geneſ. 3.2. the woman ſaith, <hi>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</hi> ſhe ſaith not, <hi>We muſteat,</hi> or <hi>We are charged;</hi> much leſſe, <hi>preſently, ſo ſoon as we ſee them,</hi> or <hi>before we do other things.</hi> Fourthly, Geneſ. 9.3. <hi>Every moving thing that liveth ſhall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</hi> Are we commanded to eat every beaſt, and every herb? then whoſoever forbeareth any one, ſinneth. Or was there in this a difference between the grant unto Adam, and the grant unto Noah, and their poſterities?</p>
               <p>The ſecond errour is of Lumbard, That Adam did eat of the tree of life. His proof out of Auguſtine falleth ſhort, even as it is cited, though the place is miſtaken by him, and the words maym'd. Indeed Auguſtine thus.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6913:25"/>thoſe or the like thoughts ſavour of ſinne, or ignorance. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine in this point is incoherent to himſelf, ſaying,

                  <hi>The taſte of the tree of life did hinder the corruption of the body.</hi> Again,
<note n="*" place="margin">Vitae arbor, medicinae modo, corruptionem omnem prohibebat.</note> 
                  <hi>The tree of life, by way of phyſick, did prevent all corruption.</hi> But, ſay I, if corruption ſeiſed not on Adam, till he ſinned; what needed Adam, till he ſinned, uſe that medicine? ſince the ſick have need of phyſician and phyſick, and not the whole. If Adam had eaten of the tree of life before he had eaten the forbidden fruit, God would have kept him from the forbidden fruit, as after he kept him from the tree of life: or els the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good &amp; evill had not cauſed deſtruction, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not been deadly; but Adam ſhould have lived immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. This will not ſeem ſtrange, if you weigh what followeth.</p>
               <p>If after Adam had ſinned, he had taken of the tree of life, and eaten the fruit; he had lived for ever, Geneſ. 3.22. for els, what needed God to have placed ſuch a watch and ward againſt him? Again, if Adam might have lived everlaſtingly, for all Gods threat, yea though he had now a dead body, when God debard him from the tree of life, if he had but eaten of it, he ſhould alſo have lived for ever, if he had eaten of it before he ſinned. But, ſaith Auguſtine,
<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>After ſinne Adam might have remained indiſſoluble, if God had given him leave to eat of the tree of life.</hi> The concluſion reacheth home againſt Auguſtine, That Adam ate not of the tree of life, before he ate of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit. I think the malice of Satan egged Adam on to taſte firſt of the unlawfull fruit, the uſher of death, though the tree of life ſtood next unto it (for both the tree of life was in the midſt of the garden, Geneſ. 2.9. and the tree of knowledge of good and evill was alſo in the midſt of the garden, as appeareth in the ſame place, and more plainly Geneſ. 3.3.) If any be ſo curious, as to enquire what was the form and figure of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden, when two trees are juſt in the midſt of it; I anſwer, We muſt not take the word <hi>Midſt</hi> ſtrictly or Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, but at large, or Rhetorically. When the Shunamite ſaid,
<note place="margin">2. Kings 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>In medio populi ego habitans ſum,</hi> it is well rendred by our late Tranſlatours, <hi>I dwell among mine own people;</hi> not as if the words inforced, that ſhe dwelt exactly in the midſt of them. The like Hebraiſm is uſed by Abraham, Geneſ. 18.24. <hi>Si fortè fuerint quinquaginta juſti in medio civitatis;</hi> that is, <hi>Fiftie righteous within the citie;</hi> not as if all the fiftie dwelt together in the exact middle of the citie. David alſo uſeth the like phraſe, Pſal. 102.24. <hi>Take me not away in the midſt of my dayes:</hi> in which place, as well as in the propounded difficultie, we muſt not be too ſtrict or rigorous upon the letter. The like is in Eſay 5.8.</p>
               <p>The laſt touch we will give at this point is thus; God turned Adam and Eve out of Paradiſe, and by Cherubims and a ſword kept away the tree of life; ſo that neither Adam, nor his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6913:25"/>ſhould be able to approach it. And perhaps the Cherubims were purpoſely placed to confront Satan and his evill Angels, leſt they might bring to Adam and Eve, or to their poſteritie, the fruit of the tree of life: for if we had been immortally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable &amp; curſed, as Satan himſelf is, was as much as he deſired. So great a vertue had the tree of life, if once it had been eaten.</p>
               <p>Let me adde in the third place, If Adam had not ſinned at all, nor at all eaten of the tree of life, yet he had not died: for death was appointed for ſinne and for nothing els. Bonaventure ſaith,
<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But to what uſe was then the tree of life? The queſtion was made of old by an adverſarie to the Law and the Prophets:

                  <hi>That tree which bare fruit of life in Paradiſe, to whom was it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable?</hi> I confeſſe Auguſtine anſwereth, <hi>To whom but firſt to our firſt Parents, the man and the woman placed in Paradiſe?</hi> But that is the point to be proved. Again, Auguſtine there ſaith, <hi>Enoch and Elias eat of that tree, but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we muſt not haſtily ſay that any other eateth of it:</hi> but how unlikely are theſe things? The adverſarie of the Law and the Prophets might better have been anſwered, That there was no more uſe of that tree, then of others which were untaſted (for no man can think, that they taſted of every one in ſo ſhort a time.) Or what inconvenience ariſeth if we ſay, A profered curteſy not accepted came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? What can the adverſarie conclude from thence? for God profereth ſalvation and the means thereof to many, who do not accept of it; the fault being on Mans part, and not on Gods</p>
               <p>To finiſh this point, I reſolve, There was no uſe made of the tree of life, as it fell out. If it be further queſtioned, What might have been the uſe thereof? I anſwer, That the exact ſpecialties can not punctually be known. Probable it is, that the tree of life might have conferred much to the exiſtence of life, though not to the eſſence. Adam ſhould have lived howſoever, and that immortally, if he had not tranſgreſſed Gods commandement: the tree of life might have been conducible to his better being; yea to his beſt being: by it he might have been changed from his terreſtriall not-dying eſtate, or immortall life, to a celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and not onely an immortall, but an unchangeable eternall life. In which regard, perchance, the tree of life is ſtiled Geneſ. 3.22. <hi>The tree</hi>

               <p>A new Quaere may be made, Whether if Adam after his ſin had eaten of the tree life, his poſteritie as well as himſelf had lived for ever? My anſwer ſetleth on the negative; becauſe Adams action had been perſonall, not repreſentative or ideall; and his poſteritie was neither to anſwer for his ſecond ſinne, or after-offences, nor to have received any benefit by his good deeds ſucceeding his fall: but he ſtood alone for us, and we were in him onely as he had power to keep or break the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>

               <p>Can any one think that herein was any pain, or rather not infinite pleaſure? The beholders rejoyced: they could not do ſo at the pain of Chriſt. If there were any pain or grief, it would rather have been ſo at the withdrawing of his unuſuall clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6913:29"/>which not being likely, the manifeſtation of this claritie, at this transfiguration, was leſſe likely to be painfull.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt kinde of degree to happines, is tranſlation; not onely as Enoch was tranſlated, from one life to an other kinde of life, but ſuch a tranſlation as ſhould have been of Adam, if he had not ſinned, and ſhall be of ſuch as ſhall be alive at Chriſts coming. Adams tranſlation had been <hi>ſine media morte.</hi> Nor was his ſlumber painfull, nor <hi>ſolutio continui</hi> at the drawing out of his rib, nor the cloſing of the fleſh again: nor is it likely there was in Adams ſide any ſcar, the badge of pain and ſorrow: much leſſe ſhould he have had pain at his tranſlation. Pain is the grand-child of ſinne, the daughter of puniſhment; from both which the eſtate of innocency was priviledged. <hi>Every thing</hi> in the Creation <hi>was very good,</hi> Geneſ. 1.31: <hi>Every tree was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the ſight, and good for food,</hi> Geneſ. 2.9; and could the tree of life cauſe pain? By taſting the fruit thereof, Adam and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring had come to an higher and more unchangeable happines. The middeſſe was then proportionate to the beginning, and to the end. Sorrow was part of the curſe: innocency could not feel pain, much leſſe ſhall eternall happines; and ſhould the tree of life have cauſed pain? Then were there little difference between it, and the tree of knowledge of good and evill. Or what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in that point would there be between Adams death, which was painfull, and his tranſlation, if it ſhould have been painfull? As concerning the tranſlation of them that ſhall be found alive at the laſt day, I am thus conceited: That there ſhall be no true, and reall ſeparation of their ſouls from their bodies; at leaſt, ſo much as concerneth the righteous: That they ſhall be changed: That they ſhall put on immortalitie. If it be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now to our bodies to receive eaſe, ſhall it be painfull to be clothed with incorruptibility? It ſhall be done in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye:

Then aroſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall motion, to be aſhamed of by men, which he bluſht at in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. Then alſo, by a certain ſicknes taken by a ſudden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious corruption, it came to paſſe that the ſtabilitie of age being loſt, in which they were created, by the changes of ages they made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe to death. For though they lived many yeares after, yet they began to die the ſame day when they received the law of death, by which they were to grow old. For whatſoever by a continuall change and degrees runneth unto an end, not perfecting or conſummating, ſtands not a moment, but decayes without intermiſsion. Thus was fulfilled what God ſaid,</hi> Geneſ. 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> So he.</p>
               <p>Let me adde my conjecture. Firſt, if God had not called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam and Eve ſo ſenſibly to an account, yet had they died, by vertue of the former ſentence. For the later ſentence inflicts not death, which was then entred on them, but labour and pain, <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the dayes of thy life,</hi> Geneſ. 3.17.

Secondly, the ſame inſtant that Adam had eaten, I make no doubt but both their eyes were opened and they knew their nakednes, which was the firſt ſenſible degree towards death and corruption. For though the Scripture doth not ſay expreſſely, <hi>Immediately their eyes were opened;</hi> yet it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth ſo much, as may appeare by the implicative particle <hi>and,</hi> Geneſ. 3.6, &amp;c.

               <p n="3">3. It is true, that the wages due to any one ſinne is death; and as true, that we commit many ſinnes; which are rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into originall and actuall. Actuall ſinnes are of a thouſand kindes committed by us; yet none of theſe our ſinnes, nor Adams after-ſinnes, but his firſt ſinne onely produced death. Likewiſe, originall ſin conſiſteth of two parts; of Adams tranſgreſsion, &amp; of our corruption. In Adams tranſgreſsion were many ſinnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved: &amp; our corruption conſiſteth both in the want of original juſtice, &amp; in the poſitive ill-qualitie of our nature. Adams ſinne is imputed to us; our corruption, both inherent &amp; imputed. His ſin, as a qualitie, concerned himſelf; as relation, concerned us. As he was an individual man, it touched himſelf onely; as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it drop't down upon us. His actuall ſin is not propagated; his corrupting of our nature is deriv'd. And this corruption is both
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6913:31"/>a ſin and a puniſhment of ſinne. Some late Divines have written, <hi>Originall ſinne is ſaid to be twofold.</hi> 1 <hi>Imputed, which was inherently in Adam, and charged upon his poſteritie.</hi> 2 <hi>Inherent, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally propagated to us.</hi> So, amongſt others, Scharpius pag. 463. But they ſpeak improperlie; for originall ſinne is but one onely, made up of two parts or branches; indeed, perchance, parts conſtituent, not <hi>ratione</hi> onely, but <hi>re differentes;</hi> yet not ſo nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely to be call'd <hi>a double ſinne,</hi> as <hi>one ſinne,</hi> of two ſteps, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſections, compoſures, parts or branches: for originall ſinne is not many, not two, but one onely, <hi>viz</hi> for which death was inflicted. And this is the point I muſt now inſiſt upon, and thus I prove it apodictically.</p>
               <p>Rom. 5.12. <hi>Death entred by ſinne;</hi> and verſe 21, <hi>Sinne reigned unto death.</hi> Likewiſe, Rom. 6.23, <hi>The wages of ſinne is death;</hi> and 1.

Let me adde a little: Since Adam was made without the help of man or woman, and Eve came of man without woman: ſince all the whole world of rationall people proceed from both man and woman; it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient enough, that there ſhould be a miraculous and fourth kinde of generation, different from all the reſt; namely, that Chriſt ſhould come of a woman alone, without the aſsiſtance of man, that he might be free from originall ſinne, which was firſt committed by Adam and his maſculine brood, and not without his ſeed and the <hi>artifex ſpiritus</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>In which regard (without derogation to the thrice-bleſſed Mother of our Lord, that holy-aeviternally Virgin Mary, now, next to her Sonne, the greateſt Saint in heaven, and placed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly above Angels and Archangels, Cherubims and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6913:35"/>great Divines do make this difference; She, who was not begotten but by man, was ſubject to originall ſinne; but her ſonne, <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> was free, even in his humane Nature, from all infection, originall and actuall, becauſe in his framing there was no admiſture of virile and maſculine cooperation. For the poiſoning of our nature aroſe from Adams ſinne, and not from Eves. Moreover, if by miracle God ſhould preſerve a man from any touch or tickling ſmach of luſtfull ſinne in the act of generation, the fathers perſonall holines ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his childe from originall mire: for the traducted nature is corrupt.

                  <hi>it ſeems not poſsible, that in the ſtate of innocencie children ſhould be born confirmed in juſtice.</hi> So Aquine, and Gregorie de Valentia on him.</p>
               <p>A ſecond way is taken by
<note n="*" place="margin">Abul. in Gen. 3. quaeſt. 6. &amp; 7.</note> Abulenſis, and followed by
<note n="*" place="margin">Cath. in locum.</note> Catharinus, viz. That if Adam had not ſinned, his poſteritie ſhould have been confirmed in originall juſtice, but not <hi>in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia gratum faciente, in ſaving grace.</hi> Where they do very ill, to ſet ſuch inward friends ſo much at odds; for originall juſtice and <hi>gratia gratum faciens</hi> differ onely <hi>ratione,</hi> not <hi>re;</hi> and none could have one, that had not both, they being in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie glued inſeparably: but they had been born <hi>in gratia gratum faciente,</hi> ſaith
<note n="*" place="margin">Aquin. part. 1. quaeſt. 100. art. 1. ad. 2.</note> Aquine. Therefore do I conclude, both with Aquine againſt them, that the poſteritie of innocent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had been born <hi>in gratia gratum faciente;</hi> and with them againſt Aquine, that they had been confirmed in originall juſtice.</p>
               <p>Scotus ſeeing the inconveniences of Aquin's poſition, takes a third way, namely, That the poſterity of juſt Adam ſhould have been born both in juſtice and grace, but not confirmed till they had overcome their firſt temptation. Before I come to grapple with Scotus, I muſt firſt trie my ſtrength againſt Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas; from whoſe poſition theſe three conſequences do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily flow, as
<note n="*" place="margin">Eſt. in 2. Sent. diſt. 20. Parag. 5.</note> Eſtius his great diſciple confeſſeth. Firſt, that ſome of Adams children might have continued obedient, others might have been diſobedient to God. Secondly, That the juſt children of innocent Adam ſhould have been tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, not <hi>once</hi> onely, but often. Thirdly, That without tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they might have ſinned, by their own will onely. Againſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6913:36"/>the firſt conſequence I thus argue. If ſome of innocent Adams children had ſinned, ſhould they have had any children or none? Not none; for the bleſſing of <hi>Creſcite &amp; Multiplicamini</hi> reached to all. Should their children then naturally have been good or bad? Not good and innocent; for that is not the iſſue of actually diſobedient offenders. If they had been born wicked, then had their generations ſo been, and the generations from them to the Worlds end: and millions of ſouls had periſhed, which fell not in Adam, but in and by their other parents; which croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the main current of Divinitie. For Adam onely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all mankinde, and in him onely were we to ſtand or fall. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in Paradiſe, even before his ſinne, was a Type of Chriſt, (compare Geneſ. 2.24. with Epheſ. 5.30, &amp;c.) and ſtood <hi>idea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter</hi> for us all. See Rom. 5.12, &amp;c. He was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damerat nos omnes, &amp; nos omnes eramus ille unus Adam.</hi> By A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins conſequence more firſt Adams are ſet up, by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde might have fallen; and ſo more ſecond Adams to reſtore them. But by one man came death, and by the bloud of onely one are we redeemed. Again, if innocent Adams juſt children, though unconfirm'd, had begot juſt unconfirmed children, &amp; yet after that generation theſe unconfirm'd fathers had ſinned; what children ſhould they have begot after their ſinne? ſhould the ſame father have brought forth life and death? good children and bad? and ſeen ſome of his children happie, and himſelf and other children miſerable? And ſuppoſe the mothers had ſinned, and not the fathers; ſhould the mothers have been in the ſtead of the firſt Adam? ſhould the children have fallen in them, or no? A third abſurditie followeth from Aquins poſition, namely, That the righteous ſhould have begotten not one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly righteous, from the beginning to the Worlds end: but everie one that had ſinned, ſhould have begotten ſinfull children for ever. And ſo, for one that had continued righteous and been tranlated, millions might have been ſinners, and died. Laſtly, no one man had been certain of his ſalvation any time of his life, though he had lived never ſo long, and never ſo juſtly; which yet, even <hi>in ſtatu lapſo,</hi> hath been granted to ſome few.</p>
               <p>Againſt the ſecond conſequence from Aquins doctrine, viz. <hi>That even the juſt children of innocent Adam ſhould have been tempted by Satan, not once, but often,</hi> I oppoſe theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: How many times are included in the word <hi>often?</hi> or when ſhould there have been an end of tempting? If at any ſet time of their life; why at that time, and never before nor after? If they ſhould have been tempted all the dayes of their life, the felicitie of Eden might have been more troubled, and fluid then the waters of it; and I might juſtly ſay, <hi>O poore Paradiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled integritie, provoked or tempted innocence, tremulous eſtate; where Satan the ſtronger had power alwaies to tempt, and malice
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6913:37"/>enough to charge home with cunning, and man the weaker had power alwaies to fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third conſequence is ſomewhat queſtionable, as infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that all and every of Mankinde, even without any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, might have ſinned by their own will onely; making the happines of Paradiſe worſe then our preſent unhappines, where man ſinneth not but, being tempted either by Satan, or his own concupiſcence, Jam. 1.14. For all the evill thoughts of our will are truly divided into
<note n="*" place="margin">Immiſſas &amp; aſcendentes.</note> 
                  <hi>injected and aſcending;</hi> and none of the <hi>aſcending</hi> have been in the will before they were in the underſtanding, and nothing hath been in the underſtanding that hath not been in the ſenſes. Beſides, death was to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, not for the ſinne of the will onely, or meerly, but for the eating of the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p>Theſe or the like, or worſe inconveniences, perhaps, made Scotus to varie from Aquine, and more probably to defend, That upon triumph over their firſt temptation, every one of the children of innocent Adam had been confirmed in grace. <hi>We may not yeeld this,</hi> ſaith Eſtius. <hi>And it is not true, and there is no reaſon for it, and it little agreeth with the commination,</hi> In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die, Geneſ. 2.17, ſaith Gregorie de Valentia. I anſwer, That the words <hi>In the day</hi> may prove, that they might not have been tempted the firſt or ſecond day, or in a ſhort time; but they hinder not, but upon overcoming of their firſt temptation, they might every day after have been confirmed. Again, the commination was not ſpoken to Adam, as an individuall perſon, but to him as the Feoffee of mankinde. If every one ſhould have ſtood for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his poſteritie, what is Adams ſinne more to me then Cains, or my laſt and immediate fathers firſt actuall ſinne, if neither Adam, nor any of his children had ſinned before mine own father? But ſince we did fall, not perſonally in our ſelves, not in our immediate parents, not in any but Adam, by the breach of that commination: ſo on the contrarie, not by any other parents obedience, not by our own obedience, but by the obedience of that one man unto that one commination, we ſhould have ſtood, yea have been confirmed. Thus have you mine opinion againſt Scotus, much more againſt Aquinas: and this is my reaſon. Naturally, by the bleſſing of ordinarie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, every creature was to beget its like according to kinde: the branch was to partake of the vertue and nature of the root; and ſo, without Adams repreſenting us, he ſhould have begot us in ſuch an eſtate as he himſelf was, with a libertie to good and evill, with a power to fall or not fall. But as Gods infinite wiſdome choſe him out, with expreſſe or tacit compact, that if he ſtood, all his poſteritie ſhould live in him; and if he ſinned, they ſhould all die in him: it ſeemeth reaſonable, that we ſhould
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6913:37"/>have had as much good by him, as we have had harm from him, and he being to have been confirmed in grace, upon the overcoming of the firſt ſuggeſtion, ſhould have begot us his children, not voluble, deambulatory, and pendulous, but like himſelf confirm'd in grace. For as the Angels were confirm'd in grace, ſo ſoon as they had declar'd them-ſelves to adhere to God; (or els, when were they confirm'd, or are they not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med yet?
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Statim poſt unum act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um charitate informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Angelus beatus fuit.</hi> Aquin. part. 1. quaeſt. 62. art. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Preſently after one act informed with charitie the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were bleſſed,</hi> ſaith Aquine) ſo ſhould Adam have been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med preſently, if he had powerfully adhered to God. Yea, I think if he had but at that firſt ſuggeſtion diſliked Eves eating, or rather kept her and himſelf from conſenting to the eating, that nor they, nor any of their poſterity ſhould ever have eaten of the forbidden fruit. But as it was placed at firſt in Paradiſe, to be their Shibboleth of triall, ſo ever after it ſhould have continued as a Symbol onely of their obedience. Again, by this my opinion, <hi>That all Adams iſſue ſhould have been confirmed in his confirmation,</hi> Gods juſtice is defended from aſperſions caſt upon it, for damning ſome little children for the ſinne of Adam, which ſinne they did neither commit nor could avoid. And the fault of not avoiding it was no way ariſing from them; becauſe they who can not avoid certain damnation by Adam, might alſo have received as certain ſalvation by him, without their own victorie over any temptation; which could not be, unleſſe by his confirmed innocency every one of his iſſue had been confirm'd in grace. Anſelmus cometh home to my thoughts, ſaying thus,
<note n="*" place="margin">Anſelm. lib. 1. <hi>Cur Deus homo.</hi> cap. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The firſt men yeelding to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have ſubjected all mankinde that was to be born of them,
<note n="*" place="margin">Primi homines ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbentes temptationi, totum genus humanum ex ipſis naſciturum ſubjecerunt neceſſitati peccati. Quare ſi eam temptationem ſuperâſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents &amp; ipſi ſtatim illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us victoriae merito fuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in juſtitia confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati, &amp; idem confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae juſtitiae beneficium ad totam poſteritatem tranſmiſiſſent.</note> to the neceſsitie of ſinne. Therefore if they had overcome that temptation, they had both themſelves been preſently confirmed in righteouſnes by the merit of that victorie, and had alſo transmitted to the whole poſteritie the ſame benefit of confirmed righteouſnes.</hi> Eſtius anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Anſelm thus; <hi>The way is eaſier to the neceſsity of evill, then of good; as to incurable diſeaſes, rather then to a ſtable health.</hi> I reply thus on Eſtius, That his inſtances are in decaied nature, which reach not to our point; That the way was equally alike at firſt to Adam; or rather eaſier to goodnes, in which he was, then to ſin in which he was not: yea, in this our preſent infeebled eſtate, one habitually grounded in vertue ſhall finde the paſſage over unto ſinne more difficult, perplexing, thorny, and laborious, then the continuing in goodnes. Out of Scotus his doctrine let me obſerve three points. Firſt, he confeſſeth
<note n="*" place="margin">Omnes nati ſervâſſent juſtitiam, non quia non ſervare non potuiſſent.</note> 
                  <hi>All their children had kept their righteouſnes, not becauſe they could not but keep it.</hi> So they could have ſinned, but ſhould not, in his opinion. But are not they confirm'd, who though they could ſinne, yet ſhould not be ſuffered to ſinne? Secondly, this confirmation in grace, being a ſupernaturall gift, had not been transfuſed by Adam,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6913:38"/>but ſuperadded by God unto every one, as well as the gift of originall juſtice and grace. I ſhould have aſked no more of Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, if he had ſaid it ſhould have been given to us of God, not for our perſonall vanquiſhing the firſt temptation, but for our obedience in Adam, according to Gods compact with him. Thirdly, confirmation in grace is of two ſorts, one fitting to the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> or of ſupreme glorification. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation at its height and in its excellence, nor Adam him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he had ſtood, nor his innocent iſſue ſhould have had, till their terrene bodies had been tranſlated into ſpirituall. The other confirmation agreeth with a <hi>Viator,</hi> which is not without a poſſibilitie of ſinne, but having infallible cuſtodie, that he ſhall not ſinne mortally. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith Scotus, and the Scholium on him) <hi>Adams innocent iſſue ſhould have had.</hi> But could they, being confirm'd, have ſinned venially? Let me adde two ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations more. Firſt, God could not make a creature in which there ſhould not ſometime be a peccabilitie, ſince that is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie onely of the Almightie. If that tying of Gods hand ſeem harſh to any unconverſant in the Schools, I mitigate it thus, by the like inſtance out of
<note n="*" place="margin">Scal. Exercit. 249. in fine.</note> Scaliger, <hi>When unto any thing God by his infinite powerfull perfection doth adde perfection, he muſt at laſt ſurceaſe from bettering it, and come to a</hi> NIL VLTRA: <hi>for he can not make</hi> ENS ESSENTIA INFINITVM, <hi>a thing of infinite eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; for he ſhould make another God. Which words you muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, as if we ſtinted Gods Almightie power, but rather thus, That God can alwayes better any thing, even to infinitie; but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and thing it ſelf is not ſuſceptible of that infinitie; the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſting not in God, but in the creature.</hi> To that effect Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and it may be aptly applied to the making of a creature ſimply impeccable. Secondly, God did make Adam with a full free-will, and a power to ſinne or not to ſinne. Our will was in his, and, without offence to the Schools, as in him we were in a ſort and in one kinde <hi>Viatores,</hi> before his fall; ſo if he had ſtood, wee had been, as he himſelf ſhould, in a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Comprehenſores.</hi> For though Aquine maketh but ſimply ſinglie one confirmation in grace, yet Scotus maketh a twofold confirmation: and though Scotus ſaith, <hi>Viator &amp; Comprehenſor diſtinguuntur, ſicut eſſe circa terminum &amp; eſſe in termino;</hi> yet there is a juſt diſtinction between <hi>Eſſe in termino completè, &amp; eſſe in termino incompleté.</hi> Chriſt in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid to have been both <hi>Viator</hi> and <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi> If Adam had been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ere he fell, he had been in ſome degree <hi>Comprehenſor:</hi> ſo had we; and yet both he and we ſhould have been in ſome ſort <hi>Viatores in termino incompleto,</hi> as not having obtained life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and bodies ſpirituall, which was to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatorie perfection of humane bliſſe. More arguments might I uſe, but they may be gathered in the anſwers unto the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before cited.</p>

                  <hi>As for the quantitie of body, Adam was not made little, but of a perfect bigneſſe of members.</hi> Secondly, in the laſt cited place Auguſtine maketh this Quaere, <hi>If Adam and Eve had not ſinned, Whether their young children ſhould have been able to go, ſpeak, or the like?</hi> And he anſwereth, <hi>Perhaps it was neceſſaric they ſhould be born little, according to the capacitie of the wombe: but as God made Eve no little woman of a little rib, ſo the omnipotent Creator might have made their little children newly born, preſently to be great: Even many beaſts, a while after they are born, runne and follow after their dammes; much more might he have done for men, and given them even preſent uſe of their members.</hi> Thirdly, though Lombard rather inclineth to them who ſay, that the new-born children of innocent Adam ſhould have growen by degrees, and not have been preſently able to exerciſe their limmes: though accordingly he inclineth to them, who think that thoſe innocent infants upon their birth ſhould have had little ſenſe or underſtanding, but by time ſhould acquire proficiencie and perfection; yet I rather imagine, they ſhould preſently upon their birth have had perfect uſe of body and minde, (though I deny not experimentall augmentations) both becauſe there is a nearer reſemblance unto Adam, who was ſo created, and a further diſtance &amp; diſſimilitude from the eſtate of our corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature, which creepeth <hi>ſenſim, pedetentim, &amp; gradatim,</hi> by little and little, and is incompetent to the perfection of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. Yea Eſtius himſelf fighteth againſt Lombards diſcourſe, and ſaith, <hi>Innocent Adams children ſhould have had uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from their very nativitie, and perhaps even in their mothers wombe ſhould have had ſome ſmall knowledge of God:</hi> and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his opinion by Auguſtine De peccat. Merit. &amp; Remiſſ. lib. 1. Cap. 36. &amp; lib. 2. Cap. 29. and Confeſſ. 1.7. and De Civit. 22.22. <hi>Where</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Auguſtine ſpeaketh not of an habituall knowledge onely, but of the act and uſe of knowledge.</hi> Therefore if Auguſtine were not to be expounded, as he is by Halenſis, of confirmation in obedience upon the firſt temptation; yet they will get little footing by that learned Fathers authoritie, if they wil weigh one place with an other, which are hereafter to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of him; to which, that I may ſhorte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this point, I refer you.</p>
               <p>I come now unto Eſtius, who had his firſt reaſon from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine &amp; Scotus. <hi>Adam &amp; Eve</hi> (ſay they) <hi>had not begotten children in a better condition then themſelves were created by God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6913:39"/>they ſhould have begot juſt children, but not confirmed in grace.</hi> Firſt, I anſwer, that though God made all things very good at the creation, yet he might after (if he would) and may yet (if he will) make things better then they were at the creation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<note n="*" place="margin">Stapl. <hi>De Peccato O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginali</hi> lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> Stapleton quoteth this from Auguſtine,
<note n="*" place="margin">Primus homo laetio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, nos potentiorem gratiam accepimus.</note> 
                  <hi>The firſt man did receive a more pleaſant grace, we a more powerfull.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Whitaker diſlike this, though he confute much of that Chap. of Stapleton: Now, if we in this forlorn eſtate have more powerfull grace then Adam, why not in that eſtate? Thirdly, though the children of innocent Adam might have more grace intenſively then he, yet Adam had had more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively: for his righteouſnes had benefitted the whole World, theirs had redounded but to their own perſons. Fourthly, let us take a more diſtinct view of their ſeverall gifts. Adam recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth originall juſtice, to ſtand (if he would) for himſelf and the whole World: his iſſue receive by his ſtanding this grace more then he had at firſt, (though he had it before he begot them) that they cannot fall by themſelves as he might. As for this, that their children ſhould not fall, but that all their generation ſhould have been confirmed in grace, it proceedeth not from their immediate parents, but from Adam as the root. Now then, weigh in a balance theſe two graces together (which the Schoolmen neglected) certainly the grace given unto Adam was (all things conſidered) more powerfull, more abundant. As if God ſhould give, in preſent poſſeſſion, unto one man enough of worldly wealth, to ſerve ſufficiently, yea abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelf and his ſeed for ever, if he would huſband it well. Secondly, if after this God ſhould ſuperadde unto his ſonne, this gift more then he gave unto the father at firſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this grace, that he ſhould not have power to diminiſh this wealth, for ſo much as concerned his own perſon; which of theſe two, the father or the ſonne, had the greater gift? I doubt not but <hi>Calculator</hi> would hold, that the father had. Again, if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had begot children beforeever he had ſeen the tree of good and evill, as was poſſible, he had begot children as himſelf was created, juſt, but unconfirmed. The concluſion of
<note n="*" place="margin">Aquin part. 1. quaeſt. 100. art. 2. In corpore articuli.</note> Aquine, or extracted out of Aquine, is unworthie of him, and ſo are his own words,

                  <hi>So long as the parents had begotten, they had not been confirmed in juſtice: for hence is a reaſonable creature confirmed in juſtice, that it is made happy by the open ſight of God.</hi> I anſwer, that the beatificall viſion is the complement, perfection, and boundarie of all confirmation in juſtice: but there may be a kinde of confirmation in juſtice without the beatificall, preſent, apert viſion of God, or ſuch as ſhall be in the ſtate glorified. For ſince Aquine there confeſſeth, <hi>That the thrice holy Mother of our Holieſt All-holy Saviour might by eſpeciall priviledge gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and yet enjoy the apert viſion of God,</hi> I ſee not why Adam
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6913:39"/>and Eve continuing innocent might not do the like, or beget children confirmed in grace, and yet generate; which he denieth. Becauſe the ſuppoſed priviledge of the All-gracious Virgin doth not derogate from the glorie of our moſt bleſſed Redeemer, I will not contradict it; though it maketh her more perfect then God made Adam and Eve in their integritie. Laſtly, why might not generating parents be confirmed in grace, when in the act there ſhould have been no turpitude, no ſalacious motion, no laſcivious titillation; and thoſe members might have been uſed without any itch of tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh pleaſure, as our hands and feet and ſome other parts are now? Reade S. Auguſtine <hi>De Civit.</hi> 14.24. and 26. moſt fully of theſe things. Unto Eſtius his ſecond reaſon, which is this, <hi>Angels were not ordained to bleſſednes, but by the merit of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; and man was not firſt to be placed at the goal or end, but in the way:</hi> I anſwer, Every Angel was to ſtand or fall by his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per actuall free-will. Man was unlike to them therein; Adams actuall conſent for us, ſtood exactly for the actuall conſent of each Angel; for no Angel fell in Lucifer, as we did in Adam. But to the ſecond branch of his argument, I confeſſe with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine,

                  <hi>The ſoul of man and an Angel are alike ordained to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> The way was neceſſarie before the goal, the means before the end. But I muſt adde, Adam was in the way, and we in the way by him and in him! and as he brought us out of the way by his ſtraying by-path, ſo by his undeviation we had been kept in the way. More might be added, but the Queſtion hath ſwollen above its banks already. I muſt be brief, though I be obſcure.</p>
               <p>What Hugo and Lombard require, was performed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam for us. Though Eſtius in this point maketh God like an hard taſk-maſter, and man a meer journy-man; yet much was given to him who deſerved little; even for one onely, and the eaſieſt houres work. So might God have done to us for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto Adams obedience for us. In that eſtate, perhaps, he needed no merit challenging due reward; as there ſhall be no new recompenſe for deſert, after we are glorified. But if merit had had place, it might after confirmation in grace have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpeedier tranſlation to an unchangeable life; &amp; the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of beatitude might have been increaſed in us, as they ſhall be in the Angels of light, though long ſince they were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in grace.</p>
               <p>Scotus objecteth, <hi>The children of innocent Adam ſhould have been Viatores, in the way to happines; therefore they might have been ſinners.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Viator</hi> is conſidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a twofold eſtate. Firſt, for him that walketh in a ſlippery and dangerous way, where he may be <hi>in</hi> or out. Thus was Adam <hi>Viator,</hi> thus were we <hi>Viatores</hi> in Adam before his fall, and thus we could have ſinned, yea did ſinne; which is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6913:40"/>more then Scotus his argument evinceth. Secondly, <hi>Viator</hi> is taken according to the eſtate of him who walketh in a good ſure way, where no by-path can be made. Thus we being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſhould have been <hi>Viatores,</hi> and yet could not have been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and herein we had been like to bleſſed Angels; yea the ſame man might have been <hi>Viator</hi> in one regard, and <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor</hi> in an other reſpect at the ſame time. So was Chriſt, ſo had Adam and his children been upon confirmation in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; not that they ſhould have had that plenitude of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion which is to be enjoyed after the generall judgement, but ſuch a comprehenſion which had been agreeable to that preſent eſtate, (though ſuſceptible of degrees, and capable of more perfection) where <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> is ſynonymous with <hi>bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> onely, but not <hi>beatiſsimus.</hi> The ſame Scotus further reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus:
<q>
                     <l>The grace confirmed by the Merit of Chriſt in Baptiſme, or other Sacraments confirm not the receiver;</l>
                     <l>Therefore much leſſe ſhould any Merit of any parent or childe have confirmed us in juſtice.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, The confirmation had rather been from Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe to Adam and his ſeed, then from any merit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. Secondly, The graces of Chriſt exhibited in the Sacraments of initiation and corroboration ſhall draw us up to an infallible confirmation in the eſtate of glorie; where we ſhall have more comfort, delight, and good by Chriſt, then we had harm by Adam, if he had not fallen: of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>To ſome arguments and authorities for my opinion, ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are ſhaped by the Schoolmen. I will looſe the argument from S. Gregorie, becauſe it ingendereth more queſtions, when this is too copiouſly handled already.</p>
               <p>Anſelm ſpeaketh home for me, if ever man ſpake; Aquinas ſaith, <hi>He did it opining, not affirming:</hi> Yet he ſaw the reaſon which induced Anſelm to that Aſſertion. Scotus alſo ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth over the authoritie of Anſelm, winking, as it ſeemeth, when he ſhould have read the direct words.
<note n="*" place="margin">Dion. <hi>De Divinis Nominibus</hi> cap. 4.</note> Dionyſius ſaith, <hi>Bonum eſt potentius malo: Good hath more power and vertue then evill.</hi> But (ſay I) for the ſinne of the firſt man came a neceſſitie of ſinning upon all his children; Therefore if he had ſtood, there ſhould have been a neceſſitie of not ſinning. Scotus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth in the firſt place, as if Dionyſius were to be underſtood <hi>of a great Evill, and a little Good,</hi> which plainely that Father never meant. Secondly, he jumpeth in ſenſe with Aquine, and both do anſwer, <hi>That we are not ſo neceſsitated to ſinning, that we can not return to juſtice, and Adams ſinne was not cauſe of our confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in evill.</hi> I reply, we are ſo neceſſitated by our nature, that of our ſelves and from our ſelves we can not return to juſtice. We are obſtinate and confirmed in evill, in regard of our own
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6913:40"/>diſabilities; though not confirmed in evill, nor obſtinate, if we conſider the powerfull mercy of God. And this is enough to make the argument hold good. There ſhould have been a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of not ſinning of our part; otherwiſe, <hi>Evill ſhould have been more powerfull then Good,</hi> which is the contradictorie to Dionyſius. For we can not but ſinne of our ſelves, and are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; though we are not ſo obſtinate as the damned, nor ſhould have been ſo confirmed by Adam as the glorified ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Unto our argument drawn from the ſimilitude of Angelicall reward, Aquinas anſwereth, <hi>Men and Angels are not alike.</hi> I reply, We were both like in ſome things, and unlike in other: but in this we had been like, That as the Angels were confirmed preſently upon their firſt obedience, ſo had Adam been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and we in him. For God loved not Man worſe then the Angels; <hi>For Chriſt verily took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16. Scotus yeeldes himſelf captive to the force of this reaſon, ſave onely that he opineth, That every one of Adams children ſhould, as well as Adam, have been confirmed in grace, upon their actuall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the firſt temptation ſuggeſted unto them; whereas I maintain, That Adams repreſentation of us, and his obedience, ſhould have done us equall good, to our reſiſting of the firſt temptation.</p>
               <p>More might pertinently be ſaid of this matter: but beſides the precedent tediouſneſſe of it, Ludovicus Vives <hi>aurem vellit,</hi> endeavouring to reſtrain ſuch ſpeculations to modeſt bounds. Thus he ſaith on Auguſtine <hi>De Civit.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Of things which might, or might not have happened to man, if Adam had not fallen;
<note n="*" place="margin">Quid factum ſit, magno noſtro malo, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo ignorat; quid fuiſſet, neſcio an ipſi Adam oſtenſum fuit; quantò minùs nobis miſellis?

For what availeth it to uſe conjectures, in a thing which is above all humane conjectures?</hi> But Vives himſelf is to blame. Firſt, for his neſciencie, or time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe; as if Adam knew not, what eſtate he and his ſhould have had, if he had perſevered in innocency. The ignorance of a point ſo nearely concerning him, had argued imperfection; which the fulnes of knowledge, in which he was created, did clearly diſpell. For if God ſaid to the corrupted World, Deut. 30.19. <hi>I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet before you Life and Death,</hi> could uncorrupt Adam be ignorant of the life that was ſet before him? Or did Adam un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the miſeries and puniſhments, the orts and effects of <hi>Morte Morieris,</hi> expreſſely threatned againſt him, in a future contingent eſtate; and could he be ignorant of his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of bliſſe, and certain bliſſe to be increaſed upon his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Did he know the natures of beaſts, and other creatures; could he know the ſtrange production of Eve, could he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6913:41"/>intimate the ſtrict union of Chriſt with his Church, by his own conjunction with Eve; and was it not ſhewed unto him, what ſtate he ſhould have had, and we in him? Secondly, though theſe things be taxed of nicetie, yet the impartiall Reader, overviewing this Book, perhaps will ſay, It was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and delightfull to problematize even upon this very point. But other matters invite me hence forward to them; and therefore having cleared, That it was the ſinne of Adam, of onely Adam, and not of Eve, for which Death was appointed, Let us proceed to examine, Which and what this ſinne of Adam was; which is next and neceſſarily to be handled.</p>

               <p>Many, very many precepts were graven in the heart of Adam, and every branch of the naturall Law was there written by the finger of God, at his Creation; nor was he ignorant, what was to be done or omitted in any buſineſſe.

Firſt, the object of his underſtanding was truth, the perfection of it was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: but now, as we are in the ſtate decaied, this truth is darkned with ignorance, 1 Corinth. 2.14. <hi>The naturall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not, nor can know the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> Eph. 4.18. <hi>Their underſtanding is darkned, and their hearts are blinde.</hi> Pſal. 49.20. <hi>Man in honour underſtandeth not.</hi> As Adam was in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, he was partaker of the truth.

You have the object, <hi>Truth;</hi> the perfection was <hi>Knowledge,</hi> Eccleſiaſticus 17.7. <hi>God filled them with knowledge and underſtanding:</hi> and this is ſeconded by the Apoſtle, Coloſ. 3.10. <hi>The new man is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi> Renovation neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth precedent oldnes; and oldnes, precedent newnes of knowledge in the firſt Adam.

                  <hi>In Paradiſe before ſinne although Adam could not do all things, yet he then would not do whatſoever he could not, and therefore could do all that he would.</hi> Adam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe excellent endowments of nature and grace, had alſo neceſſarily certain objects, about which they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant. Theſe objects were, all the parts, and branches of the Law of nature, whereby he fully knew his dutie. And all and every one of theſe he did for a while, or at the leaſt not break: and he and his poſteritie ſhould, and ought to fulfill, as they were private perſons: and for the performance and non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, both he and we ſhould, and ſhall anſwer unto God, at the high Throne and Tribunall of the juſt and righteous Judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there was one precept, and onely one, given to Eve, (perhaps to all Adams poſteritie, as private perſons: who, if they had eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evill, can not be imagined, that they could have ruinated all mankinde:) but commanded to Adam onely, as the publick perſon, as the Idea of humane nature, as the ſtock and root, by whoſe obedience or diſobedience all mankinde was to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie or unhappie, as the figure of Chriſt to come. And this ſin was not to be a ſin of thought onely, as the ſin of the Angels, who each of them ſinned by his own expreſſed will; but ſuch a ſinne, as might bring a deſerved blot, and puniſhment upon all his poſteritie, who were in him: which could not be, unles it had been committed both by his ſoul and his body, and thereby had power to infect all the parts, and faculties both of ſouls and bodies. Again, the body of Adam could not ſinne without the ſoul, neither could this be a ſinne of the ſoul alone, without ſome concurrents of the bodily parts; for then Adams ſinning ſoul ſhould have been damned, and his innocent bodie ſaved: but it was to be a ſinne compounded of inward averſion and outward tranſgreſsion. So that if Adam had ſeen Eve eat, and had himſelf luſted after the fruit, and yet before the orall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation had diſliked his liking, had feared the puniſhment,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6913:43"/>and not proceeded to <hi>eat</hi> of it, or <hi>touch</hi> it, I do not think his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie had been engaged, as they are. Auguſtine citeth this out of S. Ambroſe, and approveth it,

               </p>
               <p>Catharinus thinketh there was an expreſſe covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Adam, that Adam and his poſteritie ſhould be bleſſed or curſed, according to the breaking or keeping of that one law. What Catharinus ſaith is probable, and may be moſt true, though it be not ſo written. For firſt, if the prohibition had concerned Adams perſon onely, ſince the precept was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before Eve was created, Adam onely ſhould have taſted of death, and not Eve. Secondly, queſtionleſſe that law and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant included poſteritie, as is verified in the event. When <hi>Morte Morieris</hi> was threatned unto Adam, he was then <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> and ſtood as a publique perſon, repreſenting all his branches. If it concerned him, as a private perſon, he onely ſhould perſonally have died, and we eſcaped: but our dying in him evinceth, that he was reputed (if I may ſo ſay) a generall, univerſall feoffee or perſon, to whoſe freewill the happie or unhappie future eſtate of all his deſcendants was intruſted; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, to live for ever, upon the obſervance of one law; or to die the death, for the breach of it.

And (I think) I ſhall not erre, if I collect from the correlative correſpondencie, which muſt be between the Type
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6913:43"/>and the Antitype, the ſhadow and the ſubſtance, That the firſt Adam knew his <gap reason="foreign">

<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. De Gen. ad lit. 11.18.</note> Auguſtine hath this wittie <hi>Quaere, Whether Adam and Eve foreknew their fall?</hi> For if he did before hand know that he ſhould ſinne, and that God would revenge it, whence could he be happie? and ſo he was in Paradiſe, yet not happie. If he did not foreknow his fall; then by this ignorance he was either uncertain of that bleſſedneſſe; and how was he then truly bleſſed? or certain by a falſe hope, and not by a right knowledge; and then how was he not a fool? I anſwer, They did not know that they ſhould fall, or ſinne; for there was no neceſſitie laid upon them; and to know the unalterable certaintie of a thing contingent (as their future eſtate was) is to take away the nature of its contingencie, and to make it unavoidable. But for all this ignorance, they were certain enough of bleſſedneſſe, if they would themſelves; and their wills and perſons were in Paradiſe bleſſed, though changeable, though not ſo wholy bleſſed as good Angels are, or as the Saints ſhall be. For if we ſay, Nothing is bleſſed but what hath attained abſolute certainty, and the height of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe; the very bleſſed Spirits of heaven ſhall not be ſaid to be bleſſed, eſpecially if they be compared with God, who onely is bleſſed. And ſo Adam and Eve were <hi>beati modo quodam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriori, non tamen nullo,</hi> that I anſwer in Auguſtines words. Again, to the former part of this Queſtion I anſwer, That they knew before hand that they could ſinne, and that God would puniſh them, if they did ſinne; and yet for all this, they had the grace given to ſtand, if they would, and ſo to avoid both ſinne and puniſhment; and withall they knew that they had that grace. But if before hand they had known, or could have known that they ſhould have ſinned, they could not have been happie in Paradiſe, yet, as they were in Paradiſe, they were happie, though they knew not that they ſhould fall. For if men on earth may be called <hi>Saints, Saints of light, Bleſſed,</hi> (as they are often) and <hi>Spirituall,</hi> Galat. 6.1, though they were in their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6913:44"/>bodies to paſſe through both temptations and tribulations, and can not divers times but fall: much more Adam might be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in Paradiſe, who though he ſaw he might fall, yet he ſaw alſo he might have ſtood; <hi>and ſo rejoyced,</hi> ſaith Auguſtine himſelf, <hi>for the reward to come, that he endured no tribulation for the preſent.</hi> Laſtly, to S. Auguſtines three-headed <hi>Dilemma</hi> I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing. There is a threefold ignorance. The firſt is <hi>pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> when one is prepoſſeſſed with a falſe opinion, excluding knowledge: this may be called <hi>poſitive igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or <hi>plain errour.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>ignorantia privationis,</hi> when a man knoweth not what he is bound to know: neither of theſe can conſiſt with bleſſedneſſe, nor was in innocent Adam. But there is a third, viz. <hi>ignoratio ſimplicis neſcientiae,</hi> when we know not ſuch things as we need not to know. This was in Adam, and is in good Angels: yea Chriſt himſelf knew not ſome things. This ignorance is not ſinfull, nor erronious, not making either imaginarily happie, or fooliſh.</p>

But certainly ſhe ſinned before Adam, &amp; being carried headlong with the <hi>Bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apparens,</hi> did little imagine to work ſo much miſchief. Had ſhe known that her huſbands yeelding ſhould neceſſarily and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly bring forth death to him and all his poſteritie, and after that have offered him the forbidden fruit, ſhe had been full of deceit, and her intentions had been ſtained with the juſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſeducement. But ſhe might think her ſinne was little or none, and perſwade herſelf ſhe ſhould not die, and relate that perſwaſion to her huſband; or think onely of Gods mercy, who had never taſted of his judgements. And, perhaps, he ſeeing that ſhe had touched the fruit, and was not dead, ſunk under
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6913:44"/>her enticements, and did eat. Before I part with this point, two queſtions more muſt needs be anſwered. Firſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eve ſinned the ſame ſinne with Adam? Secondly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their ſinnes were the greateſt? Concerning the firſt, I anſwer, In regard that both of them knew, that to eat of the forbidden fruit was unlawfull and diſpleaſing to God, and yet did eat, they ſinned the ſame ſinne: but as the commandment was given to Adam before Eves creation, as Adam was the root of mankinde, and as his poſterity was to ſtand or fall in him onely, and not in Eve, ſo ſhe ſinned not the ſame ſinne with Adam. She ſinned the ſame ſinne, in reſpect of the outward eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not in regard of the inward obligation: She ſinned the ſame <hi>ſin in ſe,</hi> ſo much as concerned her own perſon; ſhe ſinned not the ſame ſinne <hi>extenſivè erga alios.</hi> For as her good actions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by themſelves, ſhould not have been the rule or ſquare according to which our humane natures ſhould have been framed; (but for all her uprightnes, if Adam had ſinned we had died) ſo her ſinne or ſinnes, ſetting Adam apart, had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the corruption or deſtruction of mankinde.</p>
               <p>Though in innocencie they did ſee much, yet they could then ſee no deformitie: nay, though Eve had ſinned, and ſinned divers ſinnes before Adam ſinned any; (for ſhe beleeved the Serpent, diſtruſted God, fell to unlawfull deſires, and did eat) yet they were both blinde: and neither Eve herſelf did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her own faults, as ſhe ſhould, nor Adam Eves faults; but immediately ſo ſoon as Adam had eaten, Geneſ. 3.7. <hi>The eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.</hi> For their nakednes came by Adams ſinne, and not by Eves; the ſame ſinne of hers and his was not the ſame: neither Adam, nor we, nor ſhe herſelf by her ſinnes were bare and naked of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or had loſt <hi>Bonum naturae,</hi> but onely <hi>gratiae perſonalis:</hi> but when once he had ſinned; he, ſhe, and we were all naked, our natures corrupt and to be aſhamed of; and both of them knew it. <hi>Their eyes opened themſelves;</hi> ſo Tremellius hath it, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Hebrew and the Septuagint. The truth is, ſhe ſinned the ſame ſinne twice; for ſhe ate firſt by herſelf, and then her eyes were not opened. <hi>Neither was ſhe ſpoiled of originall juſtice</hi> (ſaith Franciſcus Aretinus) <hi>as it was gratia gratis data, nor did ſhe feelthe motions of concupiſcence, or knew her own nakednes, till Adam had ſinned. For if ſhe had been deprived of grace ſo ſoon as ſhe ſinned, ſhe ſhould have been aſhamed of her nakednes; neither durſt ſhe to have gone naked to her huſband, but for modeſtie would have ſought ſome covering, or fled into corners.</hi> So farre Aretinus, or Cornelius à Lapide who citeth him. But after this her eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and this her ſinne, ſhe cometh to her huſband, and offereth him ſome to eat, and eateth with him the ſecond time; and perchance began to eat the ſecond time ere he ate once, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6913:45"/>ſuffered him to ſee her eat. Sure I am, the Hebrew runneth thus, <hi>She did eat, and gave alſo unto her huſband with her, and he did eat:</hi> but the 70 ſay of Eve firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. where they are peremptorie, that Adam and Eve, or rather Eve and Adam are both together. And Vatablus well expoundeth the SECVM, <hi>id eſt, vt unà cum ipſa ederet:</hi> and the proof is pertinent enough, though we do not reade with the Septuagint, <hi>They did eat,</hi> but with the Hebrew, He <hi>did eat,</hi> namely, with her, or, after he had ſeen her eat. The ſumme is, ſhe ate firſt, ſhe ate again with him, ſhe ſinned the ſame ſinne. And further, though ſhe ſinned the ſame ſinne the third time, in his eating and by it, aſwell as we did, who alſo were in him <hi>ratione principii;</hi> yet was it not her ſinne, but his ſinne that overthrew both him, her, and us: and in this ſenſe we may truly ſay, ſhe ſinned not the ſame ſinne with Adam. So much for the firſt queſtion. It cometh ſecondarilie to be enquired, <hi>Whether Adams or Eves ſinne was the greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To ſay that no ſinne is greater then other, is one of the groſſeſt errors that have been. Me thinks a Stoick ſhould be aſhamed to ſay, that Nero, Heliogabalus, and the grand Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinned not worſe, then Cato the Utican, Ariſtides the Juſt, or Zeno the Cittien of Cyprus, the great upholder of their own ſect: or that unmatchable Titus the Emperour, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the day in which he did not good to ſome man, was no better then Timon <hi>the Man-hater.</hi> No other Philoſophers ever joyned hands with them in that folly.

Firſt, <hi>Elencticè,</hi> upon the by, then <hi>Didacticè,</hi> on the main. Concerning the firſt; unto one of the witleſſe poſitions of Jovinian, viz.
<note n="*" place="margin">Omnia membra aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter diligimus, nec oculum praeponimus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite, nec digitum auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae.</note> 
                  <hi>We love equally all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6913:45"/>our members, neither do we preferre the eye before the finger, nor the ſinger before the eare;</hi> by which he would inferre a parilitie of ſinnes, (beſides what S. Hierom excellently anſwereth) I can not chuſe but oppoſe what Moſes ſaith, Deuteron. 32.10. <hi>God kept the Iſraelites as the apple of his eye,</hi> it being more guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the double coverlids of skins and hairs, and more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly then any other outward part: which proverbiall ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, being alſo taken up both by David, Pſal. 17.8. and by the Prophet Zecharie 2.8. ſignificantly intimateth, that one part of the body is more tender to us then any other. Neither needed there ſuch exact retaliation as is required Exod. 21.24. <hi>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</hi> if all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were of like worth: for a tooth might have been pluckt out for an eye, and the foot might have ſtood for the hand. Yea, whatſoever Jovinian opineth, or rather raveth, Dives being in torment had more regard to the cooling of his tongue, Luk. 16.24. then to the tip of his eare. <hi>Where ſinne is, there is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo,</hi> ſaith S. Chryſoſtom; <hi>and Dives his tongue ſpake many proud things,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>and Dives was full of loquacitie,</hi> as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlineary Gloſſe obſerveth even from his very ſpeech to Abraham: and perchance his tongue was moſt tortured, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been moſt delighted and addulced with his daily delicious fare. If any of Zeno or Jovinian his partiſans will not beleeve, that one bodily member is better then an other, I could wiſh it might be beaten into them, and that they might endure ſound raps or blows on their heads, which any other man, yea na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fools, by naturall inſtinct would rather beare off upon the arms, as objecting unto danger the member of leſſe worth, to ſave and defend the part more principall; which hourely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ratifieth. I paſſe by all other his objections, becauſe I have ſtood too long on this, and I come to the main Queſtion, <hi>Whether all ſinnes are equall.</hi> The anſwer is plainly negative. Reaſons are theſe. Firſt, diverſitie of ſacrifices prove the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of offences, the greater offence being uſually expiated with the moſt coſtly ſacrifice. The ſinne of the Prieſt was, in the eſtimate of God, as the ſinne of the whole congregation, and the offering of his ſinne was <hi>a young bullock without blemiſh,</hi> Levit. 4.3. If a Magiſtrate ſinned, he was to offer <hi>a kid of the goats, a male without blemiſh,</hi> verſ. 23. If an ordinarie man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, <hi>a female</hi> ſerved the turn, verſ. 28. and 32. whether it were of goats or lambes. Where the beſt, greateſt, and coſtlieſt of oblations doth not prove, that the eſtate, or the perſon of the Prieſt was better and more noble then the eſtate or perſon of the King, or ſupreme Civill Magiſtrate, (which the Papiſts impertinently would prove from thence) but the Prieſts greater ſacrifice evinceth his ſinne to be greater, by reaſon of his greater knowledge. <hi>For the Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6913:46"/>and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Malachi 2.7. A ſecond Reaſon may be this: Greater puniſhments, both criminall and capitall, are ordained by the Law, for ſome people more then for others: But this can not be juſtly appointed, unleſſe there be degrees of ſinne: Therefore ſinnes are not equall. Concerning the <hi>Major,</hi> view it evinced in theſe inſtances: <hi>He that ſtealeth a man, ſhall die,</hi> Exod. 21.16. <hi>If he ſteal an ox, or a ſheep, he ſhall reſtore five oxen for anox, and foure ſheep for a ſheep,</hi> Exod. 22.1. He that kills a man unwillingly, ſhall be protected, Exod. 21.13. if willingly, the very Sanctuarie, at the horns of the Altar, ſhall not ſave him; he ſhall die, verſ. 14. The adulterie of common people was puniſhed with common death, Levit. 20.10. But <hi>the daughter of any Prieſt, if ſhe profane her ſelf by playing the whore, ſhe profaneth her father: ſhe ſhall be burnt with fire,</hi> Levit. 21.9. that is, ſhe ſhall be burnt alive. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, becauſe God is juſt, <hi>and rewardeth every man according to his works,</hi> Revel. 22.12. Thirdly, the Scripture ſaith ſome are more wicked then others, Jerem. 3.11. <hi>The back-ſliding Iſrael hath juſtified her ſelf more then treacherous Judah. Aholibah was more corrupt in her inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love then Aholah,</hi> Ezek. 23.11. And ſome ſhal have <hi>ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> then others Heb. 10.29. There is a ſin remiſſible, &amp; a ſin irremiſſible, Matth. 12.31. Tyre and Sidon were more inclining to repentance, then Chorazin and Bethſaida, Matth. 11.21. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, then for them,</hi> verſ. 24. There are ſome ſinnes of infirmitie, ſome <hi>of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and great tranſgreſsions,</hi> Pſal. 19.13. <hi>Reward Babylon even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her works: in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double. How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her,</hi> Revel. 18.6, 7.

                  <hi>Yet formally, in it ſelf, and preciſely, the ſinne of Eve was greater.</hi> But the learned Eſtius, on the ſame diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Paragraphe 7, thus, <q>
                     <hi>The greatnes of ſinne cometh many wayes; principally from the object and the end, then from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances either of the perſon or the intent of him, or of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie of the act, or the greatnes of harm that cometh by the ſinne, or of the ignorance or infirmitie or induſtrie of the perſon. If we lay Adams and Eves ſinne in the ballance, reſpecting the object and the end, it weighed alike; both of them beleeved the Serpent, both would be like God, both ate of the fruit forbidden, both excuſed their faults: but weigh the circumſtances</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the mans ſinne was ſimply greater. Firſt, he had more power to reſiſt. Secondly, he dealt with a leſſe ſubtile enemy, a ſimple wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but ſhe had to do with an evill Angel, of an higher nature then herſelf. Thirdly, he had the precept from God himſelf; ſhe but from her huſband. Fourthly, he was to be head over his wife, and not ſhe over him; and he was to reduce her into the right way, when ſhe ſtrayed. Fifthly, his excuſe caſt part of the fault, as it were, upon God himſelf. Sixthly, indeed he was worſe puniſhed, and ſo ſaith Auguſtine truly.

<note place="margin">Bell. <hi>De Amiſ. Gratiae &amp; Statu Peccati</hi> 3.9.</note> and concludeth, that both in regard of acts and perſons, Eve ſinned leaſt, Adam worſt. His obſervations are not onely paſſable, but commendable, ſave in two things. Firſt, that he makes the excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their ſinne, to be one act of the ſeven in Adam and Eves ſinne; when as in truth, their excuſe was no part or branch of their firſt ſinne, but a diſtinct and ſeverall ſinne by it ſelf. For having ended their firſt ſinne, they were aſhamed, and had time to gather figleaves and ſew them, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aprons, or things to gird about them: after this, they heard God ſpeak, and hid themſelves: after this, was their exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination <hi>de facto,</hi> and their confeſſion: after all this, begins Adams excuſe, Geneſ. 3.12. and Eves, verſ. 13. The diverſitie of theſe ſeverall actions, and the diſtance of time interceding, ſhew it was no part of their firſt ſinne to excuſe themſelves. An other eſpeciall ſinne it was, aggravating the former: and in this ſinne Adam ſinned worſt, as accuſing God, indirectly, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch an helper to him as had hurt him. Who will ſee things more at large, let him conſult with Eſtius and Bellarmine, unto whom, for the main, I do ſubſcribe; though I make the laſt part, and act of Adam and Eves ſinne, to be their reall orall manducation. The ſecond ſcape of Bellarmine is, that whereas in true Divinitie, the fall of mankinde is a conſequent of our firſt parents tranſgreſſion; Bellarmine makes it one of the ſeven acts of their ſinne, confounding the cauſe with the effect, and not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhing the fault from the puniſhment. May I adde theſe things: Out of the words of Scotus, I thus argue, Originall juſtice was given to Adam, as to the worthier, abler, and wiſer perſon; yea, it was ſo given, that if he loſt it, he was to loſe it for himſelf and his whole poſteritie. But it was not ſo given, or infeoffeed to Eve; therefore ſince he failed, when the truſt of the whole World was repoſed on him, his ſinne muſt needs be much more hainous then hers. If the firſt ſinning Angel was the greateſt delinquent, though none of the other Angels ſinned in him, but each of himſelf, by his own proper will; then Adam certainly ſinned worſe, who bare our perſons, and being the Referre, to whom our bleſſedneſſe or curſedneſſe was intruſted, drew us all into unhappineſſe. For <hi>the woman was but the incompleat principle of offending,</hi> ſaith Gorran: But <hi>by Adams firſt ſinne we loſt the good of nature,

By Adams other tranſgreſſions the good of perſonall grace was diminiſhed, and might be recovered, but the Naturall good traducible could not be regained by any repentance. The greatneſſe of Adams ſinne appeared in that he might ſo eaſily have kept the precept,

                  <hi>How great iniquitie was there in ſinning, where ſuch facilitie was of not ſinning!</hi> ſaith Auguſtine. Indeed to eat of the apple ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a ſmall matter to the carnall eyes of men, but in the leaſt thing to be diſobedient is not the leaſt offence; for as <hi>to obey is better then ſacrifice,</hi> ſo <hi>diſobedience is as the ſinne of witchcraft, and tranſgreſsion is wickedneſſe and idolatrie,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22, 23. Naaman, who would have performed a greater matter, ſhould much more willingly have been ruled by the Prophet in a trifle: it was the well-poiſed argument of his ſervants, 2. Kings 5.13. and his correſpondent obedience was juſtly rewarded with health. But Adam, beſides the ſmallnes of the matter it ſelf, erred groſly in the manner: for God did not appoint him any hard work, no laborious task to perform. Omiſſion is of an eaſie and pliable nature: more facile it is for one not to waſh a thouſand times, then to waſh once. Now, the precept unto Adam was inhibitive, meerly of omiſſion, negation, or prete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, eaſier to be kept then broken; and therefore to break it was a ſinne of an high hand, a preſumptuous ſinne, which may be aggravated in him by this circumſtance, that he received the reſtraint from God, which Eve did not. They who think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Adams ſinne, do judge of it as the common people do of the fixed ſtarres, who imagine them to be no greater then a candle. But if you truly take the height and breadth of Adams ſinne, it will be found, as the ſtarres in heaven, of greatnes almoſt incredible; divers of them, in their ſeverall ſtations, being greater then the whole earth. Perhaps one of the reaſons, why the Apoſtle, Heb. 11. nameth not Adam among the old faithfull Heroes, was this, becauſe he committed a greater ſinne then any of them. For his offence hath been the cauſe of death, of ſicknes, of all puniſhments inflicted on men, in this life or in the life to come. Not Satans temptation, not Eves ſeduction, but Adams wilfull diſobedience coſt the bloud of the Sonne of God. And all the deſpighteous ſinnes of mankinde, wherewith the Father bleſſed for ever, the gracious Redeemer, and the ſanctifying Spirit are grieved, and do as it were grone under, and at which the holy Angels are offended, and do in their ſort mourn, proceed originally from that ſinne of Adam, and but for that had never been. Therefore was his offence greater then Eves. Moreover, God firſt ſummoned Adam, though Eve ſinned firſt, and queſtioned Adam particularly for that ſin, and not Eve, Geneſ. 3.9. and at the cenſure (perchance with an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis) God ſaid unto Adam (which he did not unto Eve) Gen. 3.17. <hi>Thou haſt eaten of the tree of which I commanded THEE, ſaying, THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> ſhalt not eat of it;</hi> and denounced more puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt him then againſt Eve, and worſe; and this among the reſt, ratifying the former threatning, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return;</hi> inflicting death on Adam, on Eve, on us
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6913:48"/>for Adams ſinne, and not for Eves. Laſtly, the Spirit of God ſeemeth to derive the fault from Eve unto the Serpent, 2 Cor. 11.3. <gap reason="foreign">

Again, in regard of its ſpreading infection, and the myriads of evils thence enſuing, &amp; the bleſſed eſtate of many millions by him betrayed to the lake of fire and brimſtone, which never ſhall be quenched, contrarie to the truſt to him concredited, I ſhall alwayes think Adams ſinne the worſt of all ſinnes that ever any one of mankinde committed, not excepting the ſinne of Judas, or the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. For theſe hurt but few; and if they were worſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, they were not ſo bad extenſively: and therefore I muſt account it one of Scotus his errours, when he ſaith,

                  <hi>There is a twofold will: either that will by which one deſires a thing with the love of friendſhip, which is for himſelf or for the thing loved; or that will by which one deſires a thing with the love of profit, which is for another. The firſt ſinne of Adam was not out of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate love of himſelf, as the firſt ſinne of Angels, neither could be; becauſe the Angels know themſelves firſt, by their own eſſence; but man knowes other things before himſelf.</hi> For did not Adam know himſelf ere he knew Eve or Angels? or hath it any neceſſarie conſequence, if he knew her firſt, that therefore he muſt love her content firſt, rather then pleaſe himſelf? Yea, if he had a deſire to pleaſe her, might not this ariſe out of a deſire to pleaſe himſelf? Laſtly, did the Angels and Eve ſinne out of an immoderate deſire of love toward themſelves? Then how ſaith Scotus, that Adams firſt ſinne neither was, nor could be an immoderate and inordinate love of himſelf? What was in Eve, could and might have been and was in Adam. The diſcourſe of Aquinas in this point ſeemes more agreeable to Scripture, and Fathers, then that of Scotus. And this it is. That unto one ſinne many motions do concurre, amongſt which that is to be accounted the firſt ſinne, in which firſt of all, inordination, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, diſorder, or aberration from the Law is found. Now it is apparent, that exorbitancy or deordination is ſooner in the inward motion of the ſoul, then it is in the bodie; and among
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6913:51"/>the interiour motions of the ſoul, the appetite is firſt moved toward the end it ſelf, then toward the means leading toward the end: and therefore there was the firſt ſinne of Adam, where was the firſt deſire of an unlawfull and diſordered end. The ſumme is, Man deſired an illicit ſeeming ſpirituall good; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, to ſubſiſt of himſelf, as God doth. Which firſt act or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pride, or inward diſobedience, being all one with the firſt inclination to break the Law of God and to eat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, and being accompanied with that chain of other evill motions &amp; actions before mentioned, was conſummated by the outward diſobedience in the orall eating the food inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. And the time was ſo ſhort between the ſinfull <hi>motus primo-primus</hi> in the ſoul, and the various continued difformitie of other ebullitions, which were coherent and bound up in that unhappie knot of outward diſobedience, that we may ſafely ſay, it was one ſinne <hi>aggregativè;</hi> and every particular evill thought, act, or motion, from his fare-well given unto inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, unto his plain down-fall; from the laſt of his inward obedience, unto his firſt outward diſobedience, compleat and ended, was a parcell or branch of that one great ſinne which was againſt that Law divine, Geneſ. 2.17. As our Saviour ſaith, Matth. 5.28. <hi>Whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart:</hi> So, ſo ſoon as ever Adam looked on the apple to luſt after it, the firſt inward motion, tending to this luſt of pride or diſobedience, was averſe from the Law, though the externall treſpaſſe made the ſinne to be full, and the breach to be palpable and evident. And as it is but one conſummate adulterie, though divers evil thoughts, <hi>&amp; multae moroſae cogitationes, many wilde motions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre unto it: ſo may Adams ſinne be ſaid to be but one, though conſiſting of divers parts and branches, from the primative ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall inclination of averſion, to the hindmoſt bodily forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummation of his diſobedience.
<note place="margin">Eſt.

Firſt, That he makes originall ſinne no ſinne, but an obnoxietie to puniſhment. Secondly, That children want all ſinne, and yet are by him made ſinners. Thirdly, That he makes no inherent originall ſinne in every one. Whitaker ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a fourth abſurdity, That he teacheth children are damned, who yet have no ſinne. I return to Holcot, who addeth, <hi>Others ſay, Originall ſinne is the pure privation of juſtice originall, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which is nothing in nature, but a pure privation and want of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in ſubjecto apto nato. Yet,</hi> ſaith Holcot, <hi>(as I have ſaid other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) it appeareth not to me, that any ſuch pure privation is either originall or actuall ſinne.</hi> At laſt, Holcot profeſſeth to follow Lombard, holding, that originall ſinne is an evill habit with which we are born, and which we contract from the beginning of our nativitie. This habit is concupiſcence, this concupiſcence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6913:52"/>is a vice, <hi>quod parvulum habilem concupiſcere facit, adultum verò &amp; concupiſcentem reddit;</hi> and this he fathereth on Auguſtine.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6913:53"/>ſinne is no matter of repentance: for a man doth not well repent of that ſinne which he hath not committed himſelf, and which was not in his power. Now we have not our ſelves committed originall ſinne, but we draw it from Adam by naturall propagation: whereupon it is ſaid, Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>of Eſau and Jacob, THEY HAD DONE NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL.</hi> Firſt, I anſwer to the place of Scripture, confeſſing it is ſpoken of Eſau, wicked Eſau, that he had done no evill; and of Jacob, good Jacob, that he had done no good. Again, it is ſpoken of both of them, before they were born. But ſecondly, it is ſpoken of actuall ſinnes and actuall goodnes; that neither did Jacob good, actuall good, any good in the wombe, nor Eſau any actuall evil. For the bodily organs are not ſo fitted, that they exerciſe ſuch actions as produce good or evil. The words do evince ſo much, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>practically working no good nor evil.</hi> Yet, though God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended not upon their works (as the Apoſtle there argueth) for all that, they might and did commit originall ſinne, and in it were conceived: and the promiſe was made to Rebecca, after ſhe conceived, Geneſ. 25.23. It being then manifeſt, that the place of the Apoſtle affordeth no patrociny to Bellarmine, I ſay originall ſinne is in part the matter of Repentance; otherwiſe, David in his chiefeſt penitentiall Pſalme, 51.5. would not have charged himſelf with that ſinne, nor needed not ſo vehemently to call for mercy. Again, we may be ſaid to commit originall ſinne, and originall ſinne to have been in our power, as we were in Adam, as we would have done the like, and the like againſt Adam, as Adam did againſt us, if we had ſtood in Adams place, as he did ſtand in our ſtead. Thirdly, our will was in his will, &amp; what he did we did: Bellarmines Philoſophie here ſwalloweth up his Divinitie. Fourthly, he muſt not take <hi>committere</hi> ſtrictly, for a full free deliberate action of commiſſion; nor <hi>trahere</hi> ſtrictly, for a meer paſſion: but (as I ſhall make it appear) there is ſome little inclination, from the matter to the form, of the body to the ſoul, as alſo of the ſoul to the body; and that the ſoul is neither as a block or ſtone on the one ſide, to receive durt and be integrally paſſive, nor yet ſo active as to make the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne to be actuall. So that it neither properly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, nor properly contracteth, draweth, or receiveth originall ſinne: and yet in a large ſenſe may be ſaid both to commit and to receive. Fifthly, if Bellarmine be punctilious for the terms, himſelf is faultie: For he ſaith,
<note n="*" place="margin">Trahimus ab Adam originale peccatum.</note> 
                  <hi>We do attract originall ſinne from Adam.</hi> Is there any <hi>attraction</hi> on our part, if there be no action? Or is action, or attraction without ſome kinde of commiſſion? Sixthly, hath the whole Church of God prayed for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion aſwell of originall ſinne as of actuall, if it be not the matter of repentance? Or needeth not one unbaptized, till he come of age, repent before Baptiſme, for his originall ſinne?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6913:53"/>Laſtly, why are children baptized, but that originall ſinne is matter of repentance?</p>
               <p>To ſet all things better in order, and to cleare all miſts, you are to know, that there is wonderfull miſtaking, and ambiguitie, whil'ſt originall ſinne is confounded with Adams actuall ſinne, and one taken for another, whil'ſt the cauſe is undiſtinguiſhed from the effect, when indeed there is a great traverſe between them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Somewhat according to the new Maſters of method, the efficient cauſe of Adams ſinne was both outward and inward.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The inward efficient cauſe was; firſt, the faculties of the ſoul, which we may terme the <hi>principium activum,</hi> and was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; then the ill uſe of theſe faculties, the miſimploying of his free-will, which you may ſtile <hi>principium actuale,</hi> and was the more propinque cauſe. But the cauſe efficient of originall ſinne was, outwardly, the actuall ſinne of Adam; inwardly, the conjunction of the ſoul, after the propagation of nature. The matter of Adams ſinne, <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> was the whole perſon and nature of Adam, and his poſteritie deſcending from him <hi>per viam ſeminalem; objectivè,</hi> the liking, touching, and eating of the forbidden fruit. The matter of originall ſinne, <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> is all of our nature, and every one of mankinde, <hi>ſecundum ſe totum &amp; totum ſui,</hi> coming the ordinarie way of generation: in ſo much, that all and every of the faculties of the ſoul and bodie, of all and every one of us, is ſubject to all and every ſinne, which hath been, or may ever hereafter be committed: and this cometh onely from this originall ſinne, and the inclination wrapped up in it. The matter <hi>objectivè,</hi> is both <hi>carentia juſtitiae originalis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitae ineſſe,</hi> and the vices contrarie unto it, now filling up its room and ſtead. <hi>Formalis ratio of Adams firſt ſinne was averſion from God, the ratio materialis was his converſion to a changeable good,</hi> ſaith
<note n="*" place="margin">Stapl. De Originali Peccato 1.12.</note> Stapleton: both theſe are knit up in one diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And ſo, the formall cauſe of Adams ſinne was diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the formall cauſe of our originall ſinne is the deformitie and corruption of nature, falne and propagated, inclining to ſinne ſo ſoon as is poſſible, and (without a divine hand of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint) as much as is poſſible. The end of Adams ſinne was in his intention, primarily, <hi>To know good and evill;</hi> ſecundarily, to prefer temporals before ſpirituals; whil'ſt indeed he eſteemed the <hi>Bonum apparens</hi> before the <hi>Bonum verum revera,</hi> or <hi>reale.</hi> In
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6913:54"/>mankinde after him no end can be found of originall ſinne, ſince we contract it when we have <hi>nullum verum aſpectum, reſpectum, intuitum, vel-ſinem.</hi> For <hi>Finis &amp; bonum convertuntur.</hi> There is no end of evill, <hi>per ſe, ſed ex accidenti;</hi> and ſo Gods Glory is the ſupreme end of all ſinne. The effects of Adams actuall ſinne were, his <hi>Corruptio perſonae, Reatus, &amp; Poena,</hi> as he was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by himſelf, till he repented; but as he was the Referree and Repreſentor of mankinde, the effects were, The corruption of our nature, our fault, our guiltines, our puniſhment, till we be freed. The effects of our originall ſinne are, ſinnes actuall, with all the penalties or puniſhments due to them. Moreover, that we may more diſtinctly enlarge this point, and remove the doubtfulneſſe of termes, know, that in a larger ſenſe, the actuall ſinne of Adam may in a ſort be ſaid to be originall ſinne; it may be called Adams originall ſinne, as it was firſt and originally in him. It may be originall ſinne both of Adam and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; becauſe our naturall defects, and all manner of ſinnes flowed originally from this onely ſinne, as from a defiled foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Yet properly, this ſinne was in him actually, in us poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; in him explicitly, in us implicitly; in him perſonally, in us naturally; in him <hi>perſe,</hi> in us <hi>per accidens.</hi> And that his firſt ſinne or averſion from God, may both be ſaid to be his originall ſinne, and the cauſe alſo of our originall ſinne; the cauſe, not phyſicall or naturall (for he doth not traduce, by the vertue of that ſinne, any real thing which is properly ſinfull, unto his poſterity) but it was and is the morall cauſe of our originall ſinne. As originall ſinne is by ſome deſcribed, namely, <hi>to be propagated, to be in all alike,</hi> and <hi>to be in the humane creature at the beginning of his being,</hi> or to be <hi>an hereditarie tranſgreſsion:</hi> ſo Adam had not originall ſinne, but onely his poſterity. As ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne is defined to be <hi>That</hi>

It can not ſink into my head, that God would have imputed unto us Adams fault, by his abſolute irreſpective decretory will of good pleaſure: but that he whoſe foreſight reacheth to things that are not, yea to things that ſhall never be, much more to things certainly future (of which in another place) did foreknow and preconſider, that every one of mankinde, if they had been in Adams ſtate and place, would have done as Adam did. Therefore, let us not accuſe God, or lay the fault onely on Adam; our ſelves would have done ſo. For, as one ſaid concerning the thief on the Croſſe, confeſſing Chriſt when Chriſt was on the Croſſe nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, naked, pained, reviled, ſcorned, dying, and forſaken of his own Diſciples, <hi>Profectò ego non ſic feciſſem, I ſhould not have made ſo glorious a confeſsion as the penitent thief did at that time:</hi> So, on the contrary, I ſay, and am fully perſwaded, <hi>I ſhould have done as Adam did.</hi> Let God be juſt, and all men faulty; for it would have been the fault of all men. Yea, I muſt go one ſtep further, and without boldnes juſtifiably ſay, by verdict of Scripture, it was the fault of all men; all men did ſinne that ſinne in Adam. It is not ſaid <hi>Propter hominem,</hi> but, <hi>Per hominem Mors,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.21. and Rom. 5.12. <gap reason="foreign">

Though the father of the faithfull payed tithes of all unto Melchiſedec, before Leviwas born, and Abraham alone perſonally diſcharged that duty; yet for all this, the Apoſtle ſaith, Hebr. 7.9. <hi>Levi alſo who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham; for he was yet in the loyns of his father:</hi> So on the contrary, though Adam, the univerſall father of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, did actuate that great offence long before we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet we alſo concurred in our kinde, and were partakers in that iniquity.

Firſt, <hi>Chriſt may be ſaid to be in Adam ſome kinde of way.</hi> Therefore the Evangeliſt derives Chriſts Genealogie from him, and he is ſaid to be <hi>The Sonne of Adam,</hi> Luke 3.38. And if he be called <hi>The Sonne of David,</hi> as often he is, Matth. 21.9. Mark 10.47.

I will enlarge this by a diſtinction. Chriſt was not in Adam, no, nor we neither, ſo, that our ſubſtances, or any part thereof, were really or materially in him. Yet, both Chriſt and we were in him. Firſt, becauſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly we were born of him, and becauſe he was the efficient cauſe of generation; not the immediate, propinque, and proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cauſe thereof, which neceſſarily communicateth ſome matter to that which is begotten: but he was the remote, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, yea the furtheſt, and moſt diſtant efficient naturall cauſe of all; from which it is not neceſſary that its matter reach to the hindermoſt effects. Secondly, be cauſe if he had not begotten children, neither Chriſt in his humane nature, nor we now long after him, had ever been born. Thirdly, Chriſt took fleſh of the thrice-bleſſed Virgin Mary; and ſhe was in Adam, (as all others are, except Chriſt) ſhe was begotten by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and cooperation both of man and woman: and ſo, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as his holy Mother was in Adam, Chriſt in a ſort may be ſaid to be in Adam.

               <p n="5">5 Another point followeth, towit, <hi>We ſinned that ſinne in Adam, not by imitation onely.</hi> For Adam ſinned, and in a ſort imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Eve, who ſinned firſt, and ate of the forbidden fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: yet it is not ſaid, That in Eve Adam died, or many died in Eve, or Adam ſinned through Eve. So likewiſe the Devill offended before Adam was, and Adams ſinne did nearly in many particulars reſemble the Devils: yet Adam died not by the ſin of the Devil, though after a faſhion he did imitate it. But it is ſaid, Rom. 5.15, <hi>Through the offence of Adam many be dead:</hi> and thereabouts, <hi>In Adam all die.</hi> Therefore this ſinne of ours muſt needs be more then by imitation. And this is S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines argument againſt Pelagius, <hi>If it had been by imitation onely,

Or what is Adams eating of an apple like unto witchery, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, murder, lying, or the like? and how there have been, yea are yet, many millions in the world who never heard of Adam, much leſſe of his ſinne? and did they intend to imitate, or did they imitate him?</hi> Thirdly,
<note n="*" place="margin">De Peccat. Merit. &amp; Remiſſ. 1.9.</note> Auguſtine thus argueth, <hi>As the ſecond Adam (beſides this, that we are to follow him, and imitate him) giveth hidden grace unto the faithfull: ſo (contrarily) we are faulty, and die not by the imitation onely of the firſt Adam, but by the ſecret blot and ſpot by which he hath infected us.</hi> Fourthly, he thus diſputeth in his 89 Epiſtle to Hierome, <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Rom. 5.16, <hi>The fault is of</hi> ONE <hi>offence to condemnation: but he muſt have ſaid, It had been of</hi> MANY <hi>offences, and not of</hi> ONE, <hi>if all are condemned for their actuall &amp; perſonall imitation of Adam, ſince the offences of many men muſt needs be more then the</hi> ONE <hi>offence ſpoken of by the Apoſtle.</hi> Laſtly, let me reaſon thus; Rom. 5.14, <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſsion.</hi> But death was the wages of ſinne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome died who did not reſemble Adam in finning. And there is a ſinne not like to his; for Adams ſinne was actuall, moſt voluntary, and perſonall. Children in ſinning of originall ſinne do not imitate Adam: for their ſinne was onely implicit, in and with him; and they have not that abſolute freedome of will that he had; and their ſinne is rather naturall then perſonall. Yet, children die for ſinne, and for ſuch a ſinne as is not after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion; and ſo originall ſinne cleaveth unto us, not by imitation onely.
<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. De Peccat. Merit. &amp; Remiſſ. 1.15.</note> Auguſtine thus, <hi>If imitation onely make ſinners by Adam, onely imitation ſhould make us juſt by

Indeed Adams actuall firſt ſinne, or his other ſinnes after his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as they were perſonall and private, are not imputed to us. For he was to anſwer for himſelf as well as we are. If we repent, what doth our repentance help him?

Yea, before God pronounced any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment againſt Eve or Adam, even in the midſt of his curſing of the Serpent, with the ſame breath he both menaced Satan, and comforted Adam and Eve with the gracious promiſe of the Meſſiah, Geneſ. 3.15. Now, there was never any, unto whom God vouchſafed a ſpeciall promiſe of Chriſt, but they were ſaved. Indeed the Apoſtle reckoneth not Adam among the faithfull ones, Hebr. 11. but one reaſon of this omiſſion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he entreateth of ſuch faithfull ones onely as were much perſecuted; which Adam was not, ſo farre as is recorded. If it be further objected, <hi>That God is called</hi> THE GOD OF ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB, Exod. 3.6. Matth. 22.32. <hi>and is no where called</hi> THE GOD OF ADAM, let it be anſwered, <hi>That Adam is called</hi> THE SONNE OF GOD, Luke 3.38. And I think he is too ſevere a judge, who ſaith a ſonne of God is damned. The Targum or Chaldee Paraphraſe (ſet forth by Rivius) on the Canticles chap. 1. verſ. 1. ſaith,

                  <hi>That the firſt ſong that ever was made, was indited by Adam, in the time when his ſinne was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him. Damianus à Goes, De Moribus Aethiopum,</hi> makes this the belief of Zagazabo and the Ethiopians, for whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated, <hi>That Chriſts ſoul deſcended into Hell for Adams ſoul,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:6913:58"/>pag. 93. <hi>and that Adam was redeemed by Chriſt from Hell,</hi> pag. 55.</p>
               <p>How glorious was it for Chriſt, to ſave his firſt ſheep? and how would the Devil glorie, if it were otherwiſe? Adams fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves may be thought to be ſharp, afflictive, and penitentiall. Epiphanius, <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 46. calleth Adam <hi>Holy,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>We beleeve he is among thoſe Fathers, whom Chriſt reckoneth alive, not dead: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Irenaeus ſaith, <hi>Adam humbly bare the puniſhment laid upon him.</hi> Can humility be damned? then may pride be ſaved. Joſephus 1.2. recordeth, <hi>That Adam foretold the univerſall deſtruction of the World; one by the floud, the other by fire.</hi> And can the firſt of Mankinde, the firſt King, Prieſt, and Prophet of the World be condemned? Others probably conjecture, that before his death he called the chief of his children, grand-children, and their deſcendants, and gave them holy and ghoſtly counſel, as Abraham did, Geneſ. 18.19. and Jacob, Geneſ. 49.1, &amp;c. and Moſes, Deuteron. 31.1, &amp;c. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus fits him a particular ſpeech at his death, and a witty Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. Feuardentius, on Irenaeus, thus relateth, <hi>Nicodemus Chriſts Diſciple, in the Hiſtory aſcribed to him</hi> OF THE PASSION AND RESVRRECTION OF THE LORD, <hi>reporteth, That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he deſcended into Hell in his ſoul, ſpake thus to Adam, and held his hand,</hi> PEACE BE VNTO THEE, VVITH ALL THY SONNES, MY IVST ONES. <hi>But Adam falling on his knees</hi> (ſuch ſpirituall knees as before his ſpirituall hand, which Chriſt held, while both their bodies were in the grave) <hi>weeping-ripe, thus prayed with a loud voice,
<note n="*" place="margin">Exaltabo te, Domine, quoniam ſuſcepiſti me, nec delectâſti inimicos meos ſuper me: Domine Deus, clamavi ad te, &amp; ſanâſti me; eduxiſti ab inferis animam meam, ſalvâſtime à deſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus in lacum.</note> I will magnifie thee, Lord, becauſe thou haſt received me, and haſt not made glad mine enemies over me: Lord God, I have cried unto thee, and thou haſt healed me; Thou haſt brought up my ſoul from Hell, thou haſt ſaved me from thoſe that go down to the pit.</hi> Thus Salianus in his <hi>Scholia ad Annum</hi> 930. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ancient Apocryphal book affirmeth, that Adam repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Didacus Vega, in his ſecond Sermon on the fifth peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Pſalme, pag. 443. thus, <hi>Leonardus de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tino, in his Book De Legibus, Sermon de Poenitentia, ſaith, That Adam repented not of his ſinne, but remained obſtinate till the death of Abel: but when he ſaw him lye dead at his feet, wallowed in his bloud, and yet pale; and as in a glaſſe ſaw the deformity of death, he began to repent.</hi> Strabo ſaith, <hi>He was ſo ſorrowfull, that he vowed chaſtity for ever, and would have performed it, if an Angel had not injoyned him the contrary. And from the authority of Joſephus he ſaith, Adam was ſo ſorry for Abel, that he wept an whole hundred yeares. But I beleeve,</hi> ſaith Vega, <hi>He rather wept for the cauſe, which was ſinne, then for the very death of Abel.</hi> Ludovicus Vertomannus, in his ſixth Book, fourth Chapter, of his journey to India, hath recorded, that a Mahumetan Merchant told him, that at the top of an high mountain in the Iland of Zaylon, ſubject to the King of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinga, there is a den, in which Adam after his fall lived and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6913:59"/>continued very penitently. And though their tradition reſts on an idle conjecture, becauſe there is yet ſeen the print of the ſteps of his feet, almoſt two ſpannes long, (for how ſhould they know they were his feet, rather then ſome giants?) and becauſe, how Adam ſhould come to this Iland, and why, cannot be ſhewed; yet, ſo farre as is probable, we will joyn iſſue with their beleef, to wit, <hi>That he was penitent, and ſo ſaved.</hi> Thus much be ſpoken concerning the ſalvation of Adams ſoul.</p>
               <p>Concerning Adams actuall ſinne, though I ſaid truly before, That, as it was private and perſonall, it was not imputed to us; yet (I muſt needs ſay) as it was ideall and repreſentative, it was and is imputed to us. He who denieth this, let him alſo deny, that Chriſts active and paſſive Merits are imputed to us. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Divine providence be taxed with rigour, much leſſe with injuſtice, for imputing Adams ſinne unto us. For firſt, he imputeth not our own actuall and perſonall iniquities, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth us both this ſinne of Adam and all manner of our own ſinnes. Secondly, he imputeth Chriſts Merits unto us, as if we our ſelves had done them. <hi>For as by one offence of one, judgement came upon all to condemnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5.18. We are then not ſo accurſed by the imputation of the firſt Adams tranſgreſſion, as we are bleſſed by the imputation of the ſecond Adams holines. Yet is this ſinne originall not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply imputed unto us, if we take imputation for laying to our charge the ſinne of another, without any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any offence of our own: but it is imputed to us, as being both his ſinne and ours; though we concurred in our kinde, and he in his; he by an explicit act of his will, we by an implicit of ours. In vertue of the maſters will, the ſervant wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, yea performeth many things. <hi>He ſaith to one ſervant, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to a third, Do this, and he doth it,</hi> Matth. 8.9. In all tranſactions and negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the wifes will is included in her huſbands. The father ſelleth away lands of inheritance for ever from the ſonne: and though the children be unborn, the childrens will was in the fathers, and bindeth them that yet are not. But of this, much more hereafter. So are we by Adam <hi>ſold under ſinne,</hi> Rom. 7.14. <hi>Which hath reference to the originall ſinne of Adam,</hi> ſaith Auguſtine in his Retract. <hi>By one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners,</hi> Rom. 5.19.

The former more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is ſaid to be imputed, the latter more properly is ſaid to be propagated; yet both what Adam did, bearing our perſons: what we did in his loyns, by a kinde of implicit blinde obedient diſobedience; and what he propagated to mankinde, is all but onely one original ſinne, partly imputed, partly inherent.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T length we are come to ſhew, that original ſinne is traduced and propagated unto mankinde; and this is evident. For ſince Adams averſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and was rooted in the nature of him as an habit, and ſince we have our nature from him, as he had it, not before he ſinned, but after ſinne, this averſion is left in nature. And this nature is conveyed unto us by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; conveyed (I ſay) as corrupt, not as ſinfull: and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as fleſh and bloud can be, before a reaſonable ſoul be united to it. So that we being in Adam, <hi>ſecundum cauſam ſeminalem, &amp; propagandi virtutem,</hi> our firſt father tranſmitted after his fall ſome corruption unto all his children. And this corruption was mingled with the whole nature of his poſterity; neither could a man ſingle out any part of any one, in which there was not ſome deal of that primitive corruption. And Adams offpring ever ſince hath made ſuch a tranſmiſſion as they received. As if one do throughly mingle a little leaven with a whole unleavened
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6913:60"/>lump; not onely that maſſe may be ſaid to be perfectly leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but whatſoever is afterward incorporated into that maſſe. Such a leaven of corruption was mingled by Adam, and ſpread or diſperſed unto and by his poſteritie: or as a needle toucht by a loadſtone, imparteth its received vertue to other needles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on it. From the will of every one of us, actuall ſinne is derived to all the other parts and faculties both of our bodies and ſouls: ſo from the will of the firſt parents by generation is original ſinne conveyed to all mankinde. Or rather thus, in Aquinas his words.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Actus peccati exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus per manum vel pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem non habet rationem culpae ex voluntate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nûs vel pedis, ſed ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate tetius hominis.</hi> Aquin. in Rom. 5. Lect. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The act of ſinne exerciſed by the hand or foot, is not made ſinne by the will of the hand or foot, but by the will of the whole man.</hi> From which, as from a certain head or fountain, the motion of ſinne is derived to every member: ſo from the will of Adam, who was the fountain of humane nature, the whole aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of nature is found culpable in us. And the means he thus there deſcribeth. <hi>Though the ſoul be not in the ſeed, yet in it is a diſpoſitive vertue apt to receive the ſoul; which when it is infuſed, is conformed to it ſo farre as it is capable, becauſe
<note n="*" place="margin">Quicquid recipitur eſt in recipiente per modum recipientis.</note> every thing received is in the receiver according to his capacitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not doubt to ſay, That the corruption which the fleſhly part draweth from our firſt parent, before the ſoul be united, is not ſinne, but a puniſhment of ſinne, a debilitie of nature, an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſinne. For if the Embryo ſhould die, or ſuffer abortion before the infuſion and unition of the reaſonable ſoul, (as ſuch a time there is, &amp; ſuch a thing may be) it muſt appeare in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, without extraordinarie mercy, be damned, if there were ſinne in it: but that a lump of fleſh, which onely lived the life of a plant, at the utmoſt the life of a brute creature (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome abortions, ſeeming liveleſſe lumps, being pricked have contracted themſelves, and ſhewed they had ſenſe) which never had reaſonable ſoul or ſpirit, or life of man, (for thoſe three ſeverall lives are not onely virtually, but really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed) I ſay, that ſuch a rude maſſe of fleſh ſhould be lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to account, and capable of eternall either joy or pain, is ſtrange Divinitie; which yet followeth neceſſarily, if ſinne be in the ſeed, or unformed Embryo. But you may aſk, <hi>When ſinne beginneth?</hi> I anſwer, So ſoon as the ſoul is united,
<note n="*" place="margin">Subeſt rationale pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati ſuſceptibile.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a reaſonable ſubject ſuſceptible of ſinne;</hi> and then ſinne entreth. Original ſinne is in the reaſonable ſoul as in the proper ſubject, and is there formally: the fleſhly ſeed is the inſtrumentall means of traduction, both of humane nature and originall ſinne. Originall ſinne (in a large ſenſe) may be ſaid to be in the fleſh, and fleſhly ſeed virtually, as in the cauſe inſtrumental, and to be in it originally, cauſally, materially; and in ſuch ſort to be ſooner in the body then in the ſoul, by the order of generation and time: but exactly, and in moſt proper terms, ſinne is ſooner in the ſoul by the order of nature; and hath its firſt reſidence in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6913:61"/>the ſubſtance of the ſoul, then in the faculties of it, and laſt of all in the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In Biſhop Bilſons <hi>Survey,</hi> pag. 173. this Poſition following is produced, and maintained againſt him by his oppoſers, <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that is ſinne and reall iniquity, is not in our fleſh without the ſoul.</hi> The Biſhop anſwereth very copiouſly, <hi>The ſoul cometh not to the body preſently with the conception.

Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Philoſophers interpoſe many moneths between the conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and the perfection of the body. Job ſaith, we were firſt as milk, then condenſed as cruds, after clothed with skinne and fleſh, laſtly compacted with bones and ſinews, before we received life and ſoul from God,</hi> Job 10.10.— <hi>The New Teſtament noteth three degrees in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our bodies, Seed, bloud, fleſh.</hi> Upon the premiſſes he thus argueth. <hi>If nothing can be defiled with ſinne (as by your doctrine you reſolve) except it have a reaſonable ſoul; of neceſsitie we either had reaſonable ſouls at the inſtant of our conception, which is a moſt famous falſhood, repugnant to all learning, experience, and to the words of Job; or els we were not conceived in ſinne, which is a flat he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, diſſenting from the plain words of the Sacred Scriptures, and from the Chriſtian Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible fleſh doth not make the ſoul ſinfull, but the ſinful ſoul makes the fleſh to be corruptible.</hi> Thus it was in Adam, is in us: our fleſh is not properly ſinfull or defiled before the ſoul inhabit it. Reaſon alſo is of our ſide: for if ſo ſoon as there is conception in the wombe, there is true ſinne, how many thouſand concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions miſcarry, and never come to perfect formation? as in the <hi>Mola,</hi> where the forming of the parts being begun can not be perfected, but (the weak workman being drowned in abundance of bloud) in ſtead of a living creature is ingendred an ill-ſhaped, hard, and idle lump of fleſh, oppreſſing the wombe with its
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6913:62"/>ponderouſnes, (ſaith
<note n="*" place="margin">Fernel. <hi>De Hominis Procreatione</hi> 7.8.</note> one) as the ſtomach is loaded with indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible meats. Is there ſin in this conception? ſin before life? ſin when there is no motion? (as there is none in the lumpiſh <hi>Mola)</hi> ſin in a Moon-calf? But put we the caſe in a perfect conception, which without miſchance may come to formation &amp; birth, and caſually ſuffereth abortion before the ſoul be united; yet it can never be proved, that it ſinned <hi>In</hi> &amp; <hi>At</hi> the conception.</p>
               <p>The arguments that trendle that way are theſe, <hi>The very ſeed, of which we were begotten and conceived, was an unclean thing</hi> (ſaith Biſhop Bilſon) <hi>as Job calleth it, ſaying, Who can make a clean thing of an unclean?</hi> Job 14.4. <hi>It is alſo corruptible, that is,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>full of corruption, as Peter nameth it, when he ſaith, Born again, not of corruptible ſeed,</hi> 1 Peter 1.23. <hi>of which we were born of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Thirdly, The Apoſtle calleth our fleſh, The fleſh of ſinne,</hi> Rom. 8.3. If by theſe places he takes uncleanneſſe, corruption, and ſinne, improperly, for ſuch ill diſpoſitions as ſeed, bloud, and liveleſſe fleſh is capable of, the Queſtion is ended: I confeſſe all. But he underſtandeth uncleanneſſe, corruption, and ſinne, properly. The title of his pages 174. and 175. is this, <hi>Mans fleſh is defiled in conception, before the ſoul is created and infuſed.</hi> And in the body of his Diſcourſe he enlargeth it: as in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to the Reader, at the end of his Sermons, pag. 252. he firſt propoundeth it, and citeth Ambroſe to aſſiſt him, ſaying,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Priùs incipit inhomine macula quàm vita.</hi> Amnr. Apolog. David cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Pollution ſooner beginneth in man then life. Now the ſoul is the life of the body; then if pollution cleave to the fleſh. before life come, and conſequently before the ſoul come, whenceſoever it cometh, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Adams fleſh defileth, and ſo condemneth us.</hi> So farre he. None of theſe proofs reach home to cleare this, That ſinne, true ſinne, proper ſinne, originall ſinne or actuall is in the ſeed, or bloud, or fleſh, before the reaſonable ſoul be united. Neither did that learned Biſhop conſider, that it can not be called our originall uncleanneſſe, pollution, or ſinne, till we have <hi>originem,</hi> that is, till our ſoul hath its firſt being in the body. He erreth to ſay, <hi>Pollution cleaveth to the fleſh before life cometh:</hi> and more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſaying, <hi>Adams fleſh defileth and condemneth us,</hi> if he make the fleſh ſubject to condemnation, before its life and union of the ſoul. For then many thouſand abortions ſhould be damned, which never had rationall ſoul annexed to them. As for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,
<note n="*" place="margin">Whitak. De Origin. Peccato 1.4.</note> Whitaker thus citeth him from the ſame Book and Chapter,
<note n="*" place="margin">Antequam nafcimur, maculamur contagio; antequam uſuram lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, originis ipſiut accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus injuriam.</note>

               <p>Concerning the place of Job: Firſt, Job ſaith not, <hi>The ſeed is unclean,</hi> but, <hi>Quis dabit mundum ex immundo?</hi> Which may have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6913:63"/>reference to the perſon, or the nature of the unclean father. Secondly, it may be a parallell with that of Job 25.4. <hi>How can he be clean, that is born of awoman? yea the ſtarres are not pure in his ſight,</hi> verſ. 5. Laſtly, things may be ſaid to be unclean, that have no ſinne. Aſk the <hi>unclean beaſts,</hi> and they will juſtifie it; and the trees will ſend forth this truth as leaves. Levit. 19.23, 24. <hi>The fruit of the trees planted ſhall be as uncircumciſed</hi> (or unclean) <hi>unto you three yeares, it ſhall not be eaten of: but in the fourth yeare it ſhall be holy, to praiſe the Lord withall:</hi> yet was not the fruit ſinfull it ſelf, but <hi>quoaduſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The place of S. Peter is anſwered by the ſame Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>Silver and gold are things corruptible:</hi> yet theſe creatures, as creatures, are good in themſelves; &amp; though they are cauſes of moſt ſinnes, yet have no ſinne: &amp; many other corruptible things, as heaven &amp; earth, are void of all ſinne. As concerning the place of the Apoſtle S. Paul, I anſwer, it is apparent he ſpeaketh of fleſh, after the ſoul is united; which is nothing to our Queſtion, and therefore a moſt impertinent proof of the Biſhop. Laſtly, the Reverend Biſhop bringeth this objection againſt himſelf, <hi>How could David ſay he was conceived in ſinne, when at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he had neither ſoul nor body?</hi> His main anſwer is; <hi>With God nothing is more frequent, then to call thoſe things that are not, as though they were,</hi> Rom. 4.17. <hi>and ſpeaketh in Scriptures of things to come, as if they were paſt or preſent. David and Job call that ſeed which was prepared to be the matter of their bodies, by the names of themſelves, becauſe it could not be altered what God had appointed. But the void conceptions of women which miſcarry before the body be framed, never had either life or ſoul, and ſo neither name nor kinde, but periſh as other ſuperfluous burdens and repletions of the body.</hi> So he. I reply, (that I may not queſtion the worthy Biſhop about the meaning of that place, Rom. 4.17.) He hath made a great ſtirre to little purpoſe, ſince he maketh many conceptions void of finne or puniſhment, like ſuperfluous burdens and repletions of the body, which none ever ſaid to have ſinned. Secondly, which is the better anſwer to the place of the Pſalmiſt, to ſay, as the Biſhop doth, <hi>Conceptions which come to nothing are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but ſuch as may have ſouls are ſinfull before they have ſouls,</hi> (whereby he ſplitteth himſelf on this rock, <hi>That a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſuſceptible of a ſoul, and aborſed caſually before the unition with the ſoul, is ſinfull and liable to account.)</hi> or to anſwer with me, <hi>That ſinne and iniquity in the place of the Pſalmiſt is taken for the aptitude to ſinne, which is in the matter;</hi> or els, conception is taken in its latitude, for our time in the mothers wombe; and ſo true original ſinne not to be in the body without a ſoul.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6913:63"/>without the ſoul, neither the learned nor the unlearned doubts, that I may ſpeak with Auguſtine. For what doth the inanimate fleſh differ from a ſtock?</hi> And I hope the Biſhop will not ſay, <hi>A block or a ſtock hath ſinne.</hi> Moreover, after thouſands of ſinnes committed in the body, and by and with the body, yet the body ſeparated from the ſoul hath no ſinne, is not ſinfull, much leſſe is <hi>ſinne:</hi> and ſhall the ſeed in the wombe be called <hi>ſinfull</hi> or <hi>ſinne,</hi> as Kemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius or Luther calleth it, before it is warmed with life or enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with a ſoul? Laſtly, in our very <hi>Creed</hi> conception is uſed with libertie and freedome, and not narrowly impriſoned: <hi>Chriſt was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin Mary.</hi> Where conception includeth in itſelf formation of the bodily parts, and unition of the ſoul: So <hi>Eve conceived, and bare Cain,</hi> Geneſ. 4.1. <hi>and Cain his wife conceived, and bare Chanoch,</hi> verſ. 17.

                  <hi>Enoch propheſied, ſaying;</hi> in which writing is rather excluded then included.

And certainly, after all Jobs miſery, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in proſperity 20 yeares longer then the whole yeares of Moſes (compare Job 42.16. with Deuter. 33.7.) and ſo Job might know the writing of the Law in Tables of ſtone, and the other Sacred Writings of Moſes; perhaps alſo books of other men, to which he alluded; and yet there was no writing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law. Concerning the book, Numb. 21.14. ſuppoſe the word runne in the preſent tenſe, <hi>Dicitur, It is ſaid in the book of the Warres of the Lord;</hi> yet it is expounded by the Chaldee as of a thing paſt, <hi>What God did in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon;</hi> which latter clauſe neceſſarily implyeth, that the book was written after the Law; for <hi>The battle of Arnon was the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yeare after their Exodus,</hi> ſaith a Jew, by Vatablus his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, very eminent. Or ſay it be read (as Robert Stephen, in his Annotations on the Pentateuch, gathered from the Kings Profeſſours at Paris, hath it) <hi>Sicut fecitin Mari Rubro, ſic faciet in torrentibus Arnon,</hi> which ſenſe Cornelius à Lapide embraceth; yet thoſe words evince, that the book was written ſince their going out of Egypt, <hi>which was but fourty dayes before the giving of the Law,</hi> ſaith Helvicus. But indeed, firſt, the word <hi>Sepher</hi> doth not alwayes ſignifie a book, but ſometimes a Narrative of things paſt; whereupon Tremellius readeth it, <hi>Idcirco dici ſolet,</hi> IN RECENSIONE BELLORUM JEHOVAE: And <hi>ſo others have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6913:67"/>held,</hi> ſaith Vatablus; plainly denying, that there was ever any ſuch eſpeciall book of warres. Others read it in the future, <hi>It ſhall be read;</hi> and thereupon ſome of the Jews think it is the Book of Judges, which handleth the Warre with Amalek; or another book which recounted the miracles of God in the Red Sea, and by the river Arnon: which book, perhaps, is now pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, as divers others of the holy Scriptures; and amongſt them, a book made by Samuel, 1 Samuel 10.25. Which I wondred that neither Druſius, nor any who handled the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, whom I could yet meet with, ever obſerved before me. And indeed Jeamar is the future tenſe, <hi>It ſhall be ſaid,</hi> or, <hi>it ſhall be written.</hi> So Vatablus, the Interlineary, Eugubinus, and the Genevians. So the words are rather propheticall then hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall: and ſo no particular book of the warres of the Lord was written before the two Tables. Laſtly, that I may leave no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unanſwered, adde this to the anſwer of S. Auguſtine, That Chriſt, ſpeaking of a propheſie in Paradiſe concerning himſelf, doth not ſay, <hi>It was written before Moſes,</hi> but, <hi>It is written by Moſes of me,</hi> John 5.46. Moreover, if we can read the Hebrew now without vowels, much eaſier and better could they whoſe daily ſpeech it was. The neceſſity of pronouncing the conſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by the vowels, evinceth not the writing of conſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of writing the Hebrew tongue by conſonants evinceth not the neceſſity of writingvowels: they may be of a later invention.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith he,
<note n="*" place="margin">Quum duae linguae Syriaca &amp; Arabica, quae ab Hebraea ortae ſunt, vocales habeant, ut ex libris manuſcriptis &amp; impreſſis apparet; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem uempe Hebraeam, illis carere veriſimile non eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing that the two tongues, the Syriack and the Arabick, which came from the Hebrew, have vowels, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares out of manuſcripts and printed books, it is not likely that the Mother-tongue, to wit the Hebrew, wants them.</hi> I anſwer it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, <hi>Becauſe the Syriack &amp; Arabick have now points; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had ever ſo when they were written:</hi> and if they had ever points, it is likely they invented them, and added them to their conſonants, the rather becauſe the Hebrew wanted them.</p>

                  <hi>We muſt needs hold that tongue to be certain, and no way ambiguous or doubtfull, in which God hath publiſhed his ſacred Oracles.</hi> I anſwer, Then God ſhould have writ in any other language: for the Hebrew, of all other is moſt dubious and ambiguous. And whereas he addeth, <hi>That the Hebrew without vowels hath no certain ſignification, but from the antecedent and conſequent; and admitteth three, foure, or five ſignifications, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of vowels:</hi> I anſwer, the antecedents and conſequents are guides ſufficient, and God did it purpoſely to exerciſe our wits, and to make us know, that though in things neceſſary to ſalvation the Scripture is eaſy, yet in ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there are depths not to be ſounded; in others, <hi>The lips of the Prieſt ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth,</hi> Malach. 2.7. which the unlearned ſcorn now adayes to do; though there be much ambiguitie: but how bold-daring,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6913:67"/>ſelf-willed would they be, if there were no difficulties?</p>
               <p>I return from the words to the matter, and ſay, That as the ſtrong births of the wombe are a bleſſing of God, whether in women, or in beaſts, Deuter. 30.9. So an abortion is a curſe, and abortives (I mean that had life and reaſonable ſouls) by the ordinary rules of Geneſ. 17.14. when Circumciſion was in force; and of John 3.3. whileſt Baptiſme is in force, is a fearfull eſtate. Howſoever God may diſpenſe with his own Law, and ſhew mercy extraordinarily; yet David, when he wiſhed his enemies to be like abortives, wiſhed them no good, but evill: yea, if he did not curſe them, but foretold what they ſhould be like; and that they were not the words of impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but prediction; yet he did not fore-divine, or fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie any good eſtate to them, whom he likeneth to abortives. Let this ſuffice concerning <hi>abortives,</hi> incapable of ſinne or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and <hi>abortives,</hi> whoſe eſtate of ſoul is dangerous, being meaſured by the rules of precepts. Which I ſay againſt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and the contemners or cauſeleſſe delayers of that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is now ſuppoſed, and ſhall (if it pleaſe God) hereafter be demonſtrated, <hi>That humane ſouls are not traducted, nor cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally brought out of the fleſh:</hi> yet are they occaſionally, (that I may touch at the manner) God having reſolved and decreed, after generation and fit organization of the Embryo, to create and infuſe a reaſonable ſoul: which ſoul, becauſe it is united to a maſſe corrupted, in ſuch a manner as a ſpiritleſſe maſſe may be corrupted, or rather to a maſſe inclining or inducing to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in the very unition it contracteth originall ſinne.

To the former part this may give ſatisfaction, That againſt the will of the ſoul, the ſoul it ſelf can not be corrupted: for then the will ſhould be forced, and ſo no will at all, but <hi>Noluntas,</hi> and not <hi>Voluntas.

               <p>What hath been hitherto related, ſeemeth too much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the naturall, phyſicall, immediate working of the ſoul upon the body. Others are as faultie, who ſay, <hi>The ſoul receiveth no annoyance from the body, but by way of</hi> IMPEDITION <hi>onely, where the ſpirituall faculties are hindered, and the Muſick ſpilt, by reaſon of the untuneablenes of the organes.</hi> But they wil not ſeem to heare, <hi>That a ſpirituall ſubſtance can receive infection from a nature corporeall.</hi> Both opinions may reſt contented in the middeſſe or mean, That as the body cannot go beyond the ſphere of its activitie, and work properly and phyſically upon the ſoul: ſo by the interpoſition, as it were, of a middle nature, the body not onely hindereth the faculties of the ſoul from working, but ſometimes worketh upon the ſoul. Thus the naturall, vitall, and animall ſpirits do binde and unite the ſoul to the body, that neither part can part from other, though it would. Thus bodily objects work on the minde, but it is by the mediation of the outward and inward ſenſes. Shall corporeall, outward, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote objects, by degrees, draw the ſoul into ſinne, even in our perfect age, when our naturall reaſon is moſt vigorous; and may not the corrupted ſeed, having as great a propenſion to evill as Naphtha to take fire, at the conjunction infect the ſoul with a participation of uncleannes, though the operation be not phyſicall, or immediate? By Adams ſoul ſinning was Adams fleſh infected; may not our ſoul be infected as well by our fleſh? A ſpirituall ſubſtance can produce a bodily effect. Boëtius ſaith excellently, <hi>Forms materiall came from forms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall: Our will was moved by our intellect, our appetite by our will, and a bodily change conformable to our appetite.</hi> And may not a <hi>bodily ſpecies</hi> work by the ſame degrees, backward, on the ſoul it ſelf? The reaſon is alike in the contrarietie. Doth the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall fire of Hell torment and affect the incorporeall ſpirits of evill Angels, and ſhall it of wicked men, (as moſt certainly it doth and muſt; which ſhall be proved, God willing, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) and may not the matter make ſome impreſſion on the form, the body upon the ſoul, when there is ſuch a ſympathie in nature betwixt them? If the ſoul do no way ſuffer from the body, how doth it follow the temperature of the body? How doth madnes, fooliſhnes, anger, and love, with other affections, work upon the minde? Yea, how cometh it to paſſe, that not onely ſtrength and nimblenes of body, but even goodnes of wit is propagated, (if nature be ſtrong) and children reſemble their fathers both in manners and underſtanding? The fleſh it ſelf without the ſoul, if it be beaten, hurt, or cut, is no way ſenſible. Reunite the ſeparated ſoul to the wronged body, the ſoul feeleth, and is much affected: nor is the grief in the inciſion onely, but in the ſoul. Yea, in apoplexies and deep ſleeps, caſt upon men by ſtupefactive ingredients and compounded by art,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6913:69"/>while the ſoul is in the body, wounds have been given unto the earthy part, and it never felt them: when thoſe fits are vaniſhed, the ſoul feels the pain of the diſcontinuity, and diviſion of the fleſh, as well as the body. Doctor

Aquinas on Rom. 5. Lect. 3. <hi>It ſhould not ſeem, that ſinne which is an accident of the ſoul, can be produced by the originall of the fleſh: It is anſwered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with reaſon. Though the ſoul be not in the ſeed, yet there is in the ſeed a vertue diſpoſing the body to receive the ſoul, which ſoul being poured or infuſed into the body, is after a ſort conformable to the body, becauſe every thing received is in the receiver according to the capacitie of the receiver.</hi> To him let me adde, If a new created ſoul ſhould be put into a body not deſcending from Adam, it ſhould not have originall ſinne; but meeting with a body diſpoſed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, after its kinde it yeeldeth, and contracteth originall ſinne.</p>

                  <hi>The perſon did firſt infect the nature, afterwards the nature did infect the perſon.</hi> The ſpeedy gliding act poiſoned our nature; and we have not uncorrupted Adams nature, or any part of it; but his corrupt nature propagated corrupteth our perſons.

Wicked Ahaz begat good Hezekiah, wicked Ammon good Joſiah; good, not by generation, but regeneration. Thoſe wicked Fathers had no more priviledge then juſt Lot, who begat wicked daughters; or David, who had Abſalom; or Abraham, who had Iſmael; or Iſaac, who had Eſau; or Noah, who had Ham; or, to winde it up to the higheſt, Adam, whoſe firſt-begotten was the accurſed Cain. A whole family may be bound to ſome ſpeciall ſervice, for ſome diſloyalty they have ſhewed to their King.

But this ſeems ſtrange, if not impoſſible, That the ſoul, ſo ſoon as it is tied to the body, ſhould be caught like a bird with a lime-buſh, and bound up in corruption as in a bundle. Let him that objecteth, remember the Angels, higher of nature then men: Created they were in the truth, but <hi>they did not abide in the truth,</hi> John 8.44. <hi>God found no ſtedfaſtnes in the Angels,</hi> Job 4.18.

                  <hi>I am longer in telling thee that it periſhed, then it was in periſhing,</hi> we may well apply to the evil Angels not ſtanding, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to fall. And (alas!) what a ſhort time was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Adams perfection, and imperfection? how ſuddenly did he conceive, and bring forth corruption? So quickly doth the ſoul of a young childe ſink under corruption, though it be not ſpeedily diſcerned. The ſeed of a ſtote, fox, or ſerpent, hath dangerous and deſperate inclinations in it, though they break not forth long after. For as in the dark night you can not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, diſtinguiſh, or know the blindnes of a blinde mans eye, from the eye of him who is not blinde; but when the light co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, it is eaſily diſcerned: ſo in infants originall ſinne appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, but in proceſſe of time it groweth manifeſt. Humours putrifying and putrified are long in the body, ere they come to their height, and ſhew themſelves outwardly: ſo is ſinne in the ſoul of every childe; it lurketh in our nature, which was derived unto us from our Fore-fathers. Yet let me not be miſtaken, as if I held, that we are anſwerable for the ſinnes of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, or that Adams future ſinnes, after his firſt ſinne and fall, were propagated, or the iniquities of any other our immediat, mediat, or remote progenitours ſhall lie heavy on us. For man begetteth man like to himſelf, as he is <hi>Species hominis,</hi> not as he is <hi>Individuum:</hi> and Accidents belonging to the individuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father paſſe not over to the childe, but thoſe things that pertain to the ſpecificall nature. Therefore what belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to man, as he is <hi>Individuum,</hi> he doth not propagate. As for example, A Muſician begetteth not a Muſician, but a man; an Aſtrologer an earthly, a wiſeman a fool, a Divine a carnall, a holy man an unclean perſon. Should we propagate as we are <hi>Individua,</hi> we ſhould alſo convey, and communicate to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie our knowledge, our arts, our ſciences, and our Fathers holy inclinations, and mortified diſpoſitions. For good is more
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6913:70"/>diffuſive and ſpreading of it ſelf, then evil can be; and God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth Mercy further then he doth his Juſtice, Exod. 20.6. Which vertuous good ſince we do not derive unto our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, neither do we or ſhall we partake of our predeceſſours ſinnes, or of any one ſinne, except of the onely firſt ſinne of our firſt predeceſſour.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There was not given either to Adam, or to the ſonnes of Adam, any one precept which belonged to all mankinde: I mean ſuch a precept by the breach of which we might have fallen in their fall, or in Adams fall, without our own actuall conſent, ſave onely <hi>one,</hi> of which I ſpake ſo much before; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the acts of any fathers neceſſarily binde all his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Jonadab the ſonne of Rechab commanded his children, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall drink no wine, neither ye nor your ſonnes for ever: neither ſhall ye build houſe, nor ſow ſeed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any,</hi> Jerem. 35.6, 7. They are commended becauſe they <hi>performed the commandment of their father,</hi> verſ. 16. and are bleſſed for obeying and keeping all his precepts, verſ. 18. but therefore (in my opinion) more commended and more bleſſed, becauſe the performance was more of voluntary devotion, then of binding neceſſitie, or a meer imperious charge: for his precepts could not lay ſo great a tie upon all his deſcendents: but certainly the obedience was of free condeſcent, not coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive command; unleſſe we ſay, by immediate divine revelation he was commanded to put that yoke upon his poſteritie for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Meerly perſonals are not tranſmitted.</hi> Of this ſort is holineſſe and ſinne; and therefore not tranducted unto others. After Zacharie was dumbe, Luk. 1.24. he begat John Baptiſt, <hi>a crier, the voice of one crying,</hi> Mark 1.3. And John 9.20. the blinde man had parents which could ſee. Halting Jacob, Geneſ. 32.32. begat the lion Judah: the luſty-lovely Jonathan, the lame Mephiboſheth. But there are others which may be called <hi>mixt-perſonals,</hi> and theſe are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hereditarily derived. Thus through the noiſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſeed, one leper begetteth an other; and a father ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſtone or gout, tranſmitteth thoſe diſeaſes full often to his children: and it hath been the wiſh of ſome Phyſicians, and (if I be not much miſtaken) I have read it as the practiſe of ſome countries or commonwealths, that they that are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to contagious diſeaſes, or evils hereditary, as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Epilepſies, Conſumptions, or the like, are forbidden to ſow their ſeed in wholſome ground; yea, are forbidden marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, to avoid future danger. But theſe diſeaſes reach not to infect the ſoul with ſinne. Aquinas on Rom. 5. Lect. 3. goeth one ſtep further: <hi>The ſonnes are like the fathers, even in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſoul; Angry and mad men are begotten of angry and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6913:71"/>mad men.</hi> Yet in the end he cloſeth thus, <hi>It is manifeſt, that though the firſt ſinne of the firſt Adam be traducted to poſterity by the originall; yet Adams other ſinnes, or the ſinnes of other men are not derived to their children: becauſe by the onely firſt ſinne</hi> ſubla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt bonum naturae, <hi>that naturall good was taken away, which ſhould have been traducted</hi> per originem naturae, <hi>by the originall of nature. By other ſinnes the good of perſonall grace is withdrawn, which paſſeth not over to poſteritie. Hence it is, that though Adams ſinne was blotted out by his repentance, yet his repentance could not wipe out the ſinne of his poſteritie: becauſe his repentance was by an act perſonall, which could not extend it ſelf beyond his perſon.</hi> So farre Aquinas. But let diſcourſe give way to Scripture. Jer. 31.29, 30. <hi>They ſhall ſay no more, The fathers have eaten a ſowre grape, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge: but every one ſhall die for his own iniquitie; every man that eateth the ſowre grape, his teeth ſhall be ſet on edge.</hi> They had occaſion to uſe this proverb, in reference to Adam who ate one ſowre grape, in whom we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and are puniſhed. But <hi>as I live, ſaith the Lord God, ye ſhall not have occaſion any more to uſe this proverb in Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 18.3. <hi>Behold, all ſouls are mine; as the ſoul of the father, ſo alſo the ſoul of the ſonne is mine: the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die,</hi> verſ. 4. And when God ſaid, Exod. 20.5. <hi>I viſit the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, the place ſpeaketh not of the ſinnes of children, (for the fathers perſonall iniquitie maketh not the ſonne inique or wicked) it is onely ſpoken of puniſhments. Secondly, even puniſhment eternall doth not reach from the father to the ſonne, unleſſe the ſonne communicate with the ſinne of the father: for <hi>if a wicked father beget a ſonne that ſeeth all his fathers ſinnes, which he hath done, and conſidereth, and doth not ſuch like, he ſhall not die for the iniquitie of his father, he ſhall ſurely live,</hi> Ezek. 18.14, 17. In this ſort you may object, A man ſhall not be puniſhed at all for the ſinnes of his forefathers, but for his own ſinnes onely. I anſwer, He may be puniſhed temporally, but not eternally: for in temporall chaſtiſements, as there be many cauſes producing one effect, ſo many ſinnes, even of diverſe men, may be corrected by one puniſhment; and the father is often more grievouſly puniſhed in his ſonne, then in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken what I thought convenient, concerning the propagation of originall corruption unto all the poſteritie of Adam, I am in the laſt place to ſhew the juſt conſequent; That as he did die for that his ſinne, ſo we his offspring for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that ſinne ſhould die; and in regard of this ſinne, <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for men to die,</hi> and to undergo that puniſhment. For ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne is in one regard a fault of tranſgreſſion, and the ſame originall ſinne, in a different reſpect is alſo a puniſhment.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6913:72"/>in his loyns; by the ſame reaſon, the other ſinnes of Adam and our other parents ſhould be likewiſe traducted: which is abſurd, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not alwayes to paſſe; ſince of evil parents oftentimes the beſt children are born.</hi> He anſwereth, firſt, <hi>The reaſon is not alike: for the firſt ſinne was not ſo proper and perſonall to Adam, as common to humane nature: his other ſinnes, and others after him are truely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall.</hi> Which anſwer is excellent, and he confirmeth it at large. Then cometh he to a ſecond anſwer, which is not his own, but onely barely related, without his approving or open diſproving of it.

                  <hi>Beſides, many learned men denie, that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, that the ſinnes of the next parents are communicated to the children; ſo that ſonnes are born like their parents, vicious and perverſe ſonnes of vicious and perverſe parents; which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by experience, by examples of Scripture, by Exod.</hi> 20.5. <hi>And Auguſtine truely in Enchirid. cap.</hi> 46. <hi>ſaith it is probable for that place of Exodus. For, ſaith he, if the ſonne ſhall not beare the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the father, but the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die, and yet God viſit the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children; it ſeemeth to follow, that the ſinnes of the parents paſſe over to the ſonnes, and the ſonnes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſinnes of the parents, that thoſe ſinnes may be juſtly puniſhed in them, which are not ſo proper to the parents, as common both to parents and children.</hi> And for this opinion he citeth Bucer and Martyr. All this cloud (for it is but a cloud, and an empty one alſo) will quickly be diſperſed. Firſt, in the generall replicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obſerve, that Zanchius himſelf never ſpecializeth this, as his own judgement.

Fourthly, many words are <hi>homonymous,</hi> and they themſelves ſlide back from them, by varying the ſtate of the queſtion, as will appeare by and by. Laſtly, let the grounds by me ſet down in the laſt chapter be well weighed, and the truth will appeare on my ſide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now let me deſcend to the matter of their objections.
<note n="b" place="margin">Peccata proximorum parentum communicantur liberis.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſinnes of the next parents are communicated to the children,</hi> ſay they. Here they ſhould have been punctuall, and I deſire to be ſatisfied what they mean; Whether the ſinnes of the father and mother be transfuſed into all the ſonnes and daughters? and into all of them alike, or not alike? And if the father be vertuous, and the mother wicked; or contrariwiſe, the mother vertuous and the father wicked, what is communicated to the childe? Secondly, what ſinnes be communicated? all, or ſome? Whether Atheiſme and profaneneſſe of thoughts, or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6913:73"/>onely ſuch ſinnes as the bodie is much imployed in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of? Thirdly, whether the ſinnes of grand-fathers and grand-mothers be derived? and if ſo, whether if there be a good grand-father and a good grand-mother and a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the children ſhall inherit no goodneſſe, but the ſinne of their wicked mother onely? Or if two of them be good, and two bad; the males good, and the females bad; or contrariwiſe; what ſinne ſhall be communicated to their children? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the ſinnes of the great-grand-father, and of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, our more remote progenitours, be derived? and where beginneth the derivation of theſe ſinnes? and why from ſuch determinate perſons and generations, rather then from others? Or whether they muſt reach up from all the deſcendants of Adam, to his actuall and perſonall ſinnes? Fifthly, whether ſuch actuall and perſonall ſinnes as are repented of by our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and all our forefathers, be derived unto us? or onely ſuch as they were not repentant of? or both ſorts of them? Sixthly, let noveltie know, <hi>Peccata proximorum communicantur liberis,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Propagantur ad liberos,</hi> is an unknown phraſe to antiquitie: and it is better to ſpeak plainly according to the dayes of the Fathers, then in terms covert and dubious; and then in defence of ſuch riddles, to ſay no more then the old Tenet,
<note n="c" place="margin">In univerſalibus latet dolus.</note> 
                  <hi>Deceit lieth hidden in univerſals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of pendulous new-fangledneſſe is this:
<note n="d" place="margin">Peccata proximorum parentum communicantur liberis; ità ut ſimiles pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus naſcantur liberi, vitioſi vitioſis.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſinnes of the next parents are communicated to the children; ſo that children are born like unto their parents, vicious of vicious.</hi> Firſt, it is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> that the vicious childe being like to his vicious father, proceedeth from the fathers multiplied tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: for if he be like to his father in ſinne, he is alſo, in that regard, as like and more like to many other actuall ſinners, from whom there could proceed no generative communication of iniquitie. Secondly, what is naturall, is ordinary, is ofteneſt, is alwayes ſo, without ſome notable hinderance: but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens being like the parents are not thus; therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is not naturall. Thirdly, ſuppoſe a wicked ſonne curſeth his father, or wiſheth him dead, or mocks at him; he alſo begetteth a ſonne, which ſonne doth the like to him, as he did to his father: ſhall we ſay (if the generation had deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after many, from Cham, who laught or mockt at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gen. 9.22.) that this ſinne of Cham was traduced, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or did paſſe over to this laſt mocker? or ſhall we ſay it was derived unto him from the perſonall ſinne of his immediate laſt father? No; we muſt rather ſay, it was derived unto him from his laſt parents, in and by that originall ſinne onely, which was traduced. That this may the better be manifeſted, conſider theſe points. Firſt, that Adams firſt ſinne, though it were one onely, yet more ſinnes were involved in it. Auguſtine

Thirdly, none in the world were ever more eager then ſome of theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, to aggravate the greatneſſe of original ſinne. Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus is almoſt frantick on the point. Zanchius and others are truely peremptory, that all faculties of body and ſoul are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Let me adde, There never was ſinne, nor can be, but the ſeed of it was couched in the ſinne originall. So that every man hath juſt cauſe to bleſſe God, for withholding him from every ſinne, great or ſmall; ſince every man hath a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to every ſinne, even unto that ſinne which (by Gods grace) he moſt deteſteth. Therefore if wicked children be like their parents, it proceedeth not from their parents per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall tranſgreſſions, but from that one infectious root of the firſt ſinne of Adam, ſtrengthened by connivence, ill breeding, or cuſtome, or ill company. Fourthly, an holy man and woman who never mocked their parents, have a ſonne who mocks at them; ſhall his mocking proceed from his parents, or his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents parents, who never perſonally did the like? or ſhall Chams ſinne be communicated to him? Then, why do they inſtance in this ſinne of the next parents? If they mean, it is communicated in originall ſinne, they mean what I ſay, and contrary to their own words. Laſtly, ſinne originall is alike in all and every one, and alike remitted in Baptiſme of infants; yea, though the parents ſhould be infidels, and ſend their childe for faſhion-ſake, or by way of jeſting to be baptized: if the Church know not ſo much, and if the childe be offered unto God by the wel-meaning devotion and faith of Prieſt and people preſent, and be baptized with true matter and form, it receiveth ſpirituall regeneration, as I read long ſince, if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fail me not, in S. Auguſtine. The perſonall offences or holineſſe of parents are not communicated to their children. Again, they object, that they confirm this by experience. Theſe are words of winde, and nothing elſe. That wicked ones beget often children like to them, who denieth? That their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have their fathers perſonall ſinnes tranſmitted, is the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion. Yea, but they prove it by examples of Scripture. How? or where? By the place, Exod. 20.5. <hi>I viſit the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</hi> I anſwer, He doth not ſay, <hi>I tranſmit,</hi> or <hi>communicate ſinnes,</hi> which is our onely que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Even Illyricus himſelf among all his expoſitions of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitare,</hi> hath none for <hi>communicare, propagure, transfundere, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre:</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:6913:74"/>and particularly of this place of Exodus, he ſaith,
<note n="f" place="margin">Viſitans iniquitatem patrum, id eſt, puniens poſteros ob majorum ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum enormia delicta.</note> 
                  <hi>Viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iniquitie of the fathers, that is, puniſhing the poſteritie for the enormious ſinnes of their anceſtours.</hi> Yet if <hi>to viſit</hi> had been <hi>to propagate actuall ſinnes,</hi> it had been his beſt proof, That the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſoul is corrupt by originall ſinne, and hath in it the image of Satan. They alledge S. Auguſt. who ſaith it is probable by that place of Exodus. The words of S. Auguſt. are theſe in the place by them cited,

                  <hi>It is not improbably ſaid, that children are liable to the ſinnes of their parents, not onely of their firſt parents, but alſo thoſe of whom they are immediately born.</hi> And at the end of that chapter,

Fourthly, weigh this ſtrong inconvenience which he toucheth at, That the latter born in time, is ſtill the worſe in nature, worſe then any that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as followeth neceſſarily, if the ſinnes of our forefathers are communicated to us. Fifthly, he ſeemeth to conclude the unreaſonableneſſe, That they who were never regenerated, ſhould be overburdened with eternall damnation, if they ſhould be compelled from the beginning of mankinde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the ſinnes of all their progenitours, and be puniſhed for them. And therefore he queſtioneth, Whether it reacheth onely to the third and fourth generation.

Sixteen generations ſince Chriſts time, are the next parents, if you compare them to the thirty nine generations, which in the law of Nature and of Moſes preceded Chriſt.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6913:75"/>(under God) life and the things of this life, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo it is no injuſtice, if he loſe the ſame for him. The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Zarephath her ſonne, was (in her apprehenſion) dead for her ſinne, 1. King. 17.18. So, 2. Sam. 12.15. God ſtroke the childe that Uriahs wife bare to David, and it was ſick and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Both father and childe endured a puniſhment of ſeven dayes: the father in ſorrow faſting a faſt, lying on the earth, in a holy ſordiditie weeping and praying: the childe by ſickneſſe tormenting him to death. Ahabs children were puniſhed for his offence, 1. King. 21.21. and among the reſt Jehoram his ſonne: who although he wrought evil in the ſight of the Lord, yet was not ſo bad as his father or mother, 2. Kings 3.2. The paſſage is very obſervable, Jer. 16.3, 4. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord concerning the ſonnes and daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers and fathers, They ſhall die of grievous deaths: Both the great and ſmall ſhall die,</hi> verſ. 6. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gehazi his poſterity is more exemplarie: for though they ſinned not, nor could ſinne the ſinne of Gehazi; yet the leproſie of Naaman did cleave unto him, for that his perſonall ſimonie, and unto his ſeed for ever, 2. Kings 5.27. The caſe of Jobs children ſurpaſſeth this: for they were not ſtricken with death for their own ſinnes, or the ſinnes of their father Job, ſo much as for the triall of his patience, and for the experimentall confutation of Satan; yet was it not unjuſt that they ſhould loſe their lives for their fathers good, which they had by him; ſince he alſo ſuffered in their ſufferings, and might eaſily ſee Gods eſpeciall hand againſt himſelf: For the greateſt winde in the world naturally cannot ſmite the foure corners of an houſe; and if it ſhould, yet one corner would uphold the other: but this whirlwinde did ſo, <hi>and the houſe fell,</hi> Job 1.19. 1. Sam. 15.6. the Kenites are ſpared, becauſe <hi>they ſhewed kindeneſſe to the children of Iſrael when they came out of Egypt:</hi> but becauſe Amalek had <hi>fought with Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 17.8. though they were preſently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, by being vanquiſhed in battell; yet God ſaid, verſ. 14. <hi>Write this for a memoriall in a book, — I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek under heaven. — And the Lord did ſwear he would have warre with Amalek from generation to generation,</hi> Exod. 7.16. And above foure generations after, about 400 yeares, Saul deſtroyed them. A <hi>Quaere</hi> indeed may be made, Whether God can juſtly puniſh the fathers for the childrens actuall delinquencies. And this reſolution is eaſie, That he may do it, if the father hath doted on the children, &amp; not duely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them: (for ſo did God to
<note n="*" place="margin">1. Sam. 2.29.</note> Eli) or if wicked children do tenderly love their parents (which though it be not uſuall, yet it hath been ſo;) and in this caſe the puniſhment of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is indeed a puniſhment alſo of the childe. But if an holy father do his duty, and hate his ſonnes courſes, and thereupon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6913:76"/>the childe loveth not his father; if God can puniſh the father with temporall puniſhments for the notorious faults of his ſonne, yet he will not puniſh him eternally. Nay, I will go yet further, and truely avouch, that the ſinnes of predeceſſours which are not of conſanguinitie with us, but are fathers onely by our imitation, fully may be puniſhed on their children. Firſt, the word <hi>father</hi> is taken two wayes in Scripture: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are fathers by imitation, or fathers by nature, from whoſe loyns we lineally deſcend. The Jews, though they came not of Cain (whoſe poſterity ended at the floud) yet may be ſaid to be his <hi>ſonnes</hi> by imitation: yea they are called <hi>the ſonnes of Satan,</hi> Joh. 8.44. becauſe they followed his ſteps, and <hi>did the work of their father,</hi> verſ. 41. which is one degree more remote. Thoſe, who thus take a pattern for themſelves out of example of wicked anceſtours, God juſtly puniſheth. Satan having been <hi>a murderer from the beginning,</hi> John 8.44. Cain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) the head of murderers among men, and the Jews treading in their ſteps to an inch, they may juſtly be caſt into the ſame fire <hi>prepared for the devil and his angels,</hi> Matth. 25.41. And the Apoſtle S.

All theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concurre, to make (as it were) one continued act of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from the beginning of the world till the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, repayed with one and the ſame puniſhment upon the father and all the ſonnes of imitation. Now as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the fathers by imitation may in an extended ſenſe be communicated to poſterity: ſo their ſinnes cannot be ſaid to be communicated. For how can the ſinne of Cain be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto him, who laſt of all killed his brother? and unto the Jews, who deſcended not from him, but from the younger brother? Or can we think that God will inflict damnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men for others perſonall tranſgreſſions? Temporall chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he may juſtly inflict for the ungracious perpetrations of parents.

               <p n="5">5. God may, and juſtly doth puniſh ſome children eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all temporally for originall ſinne, whether they be like their parents in actuall averſion and back-ſliding, yea or no.

                  <hi>The imitating of wicked men, makes a man to be puniſhed not onely for his own ſinnes, but for theirs alſo whom he imitates.</hi> This is a truth ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that it needeth no further proof.</p>
               <p n="7">7. God oftentimes puniſheth one ſinne with an other. And in my opinion, this manner of puniſhing, if it continue all a mans life, is worſe then the torment of hell-fire, which were better to be ſpeedily undergone, then to be deferred with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſinne. Pſal. 69.27. <hi>Adde puniſhment of iniquitie,</hi> or <hi>Adde iniquitie unto their iniquitie.</hi> Thus <hi>God gave the Gentiles over to a reprobate minde,</hi> Rom. 1.28. and then ſuch offenders do but <hi>treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2.5. But this happeneth not for the foregoing offences of our progenitours, but for our own tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The perſonall holineſſe of the parent never conveied grace or ſalvation to the ſonne. <hi>Abraham the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> prayed for his ſonne, Gen. 17.18. <hi>Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight!</hi> yet was he a caſt-away.

               <p n="9">9. God never puniſhed eternally the reall iniquities of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon their children, if the children were holy. Let an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be given to the contrarie. Indeed it is ſaid, Pſal. 109.14. <hi>Let the iniquitie of his fathers be remembred with the Lord, and let not the ſinne of his mother be done away.</hi> But he ſpeaketh, firſt, of a very wicked man, equalling (if not exceeding) his parents in ſinne. And the New Teſtament applieth it to Judas, Act. 1.20. to Judas, the monſter of men. Secondly, the remembrance mentioned, hath reference rather to penalties conſequent, then onely to ſinnes precedent;
<note n="z" place="margin">Memoratur quantum ad poenam, quoniam pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti ſunt filii pro iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te patrum, qui occiderunt Chriſtum.</note>

And this is not our queſtion. Thirdly, why may there not be <hi>a change of number,</hi> as Vatablus ſtileth it? And though the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6913:77"/>Interlinearie bible readeth it <hi>patrum eorum,</hi> and Vatablus ſo expounds it, but reads it <hi>patrum ejus:</hi> why may it not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>patris ejus?</hi> being accordant to that following, <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum matris ejus?</hi> and whether it be <hi>patrum eorum,</hi> or <hi>patrum ejus,</hi> or <hi>patris ejus,</hi> I ſee not but originall ſinne may be meant in both places, as being expreſſed onely in the ſingular, rather then the many actuall tranſgreſſions: eſpecially, ſince our ſingular ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne came to him by many fathers: and it was not the intent of Gods Spirit in this Pſalme, to extenuate the ſinnes of the wicked one's forefathers, and to plaiſter this over with the title of one ſingle iniquitie. Indeed Theodoret on the place ſaith thus,
<note n="a" place="margin">Paterna virtus ſaepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis peccantibus proſuit, ut fides Abrahae Judaeis, &amp; Davidis pietas Solomoni.</note> 
                  <hi>The fathers vertue hath often profited the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsing children; as Abrahams faith did the Jews, and Davids pietie Solomon.</hi> So Ceſar at his pardoning of thoſe in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeil, and in Athens, who took part with Pompey in the civill warres, ſaid, <hi>They were excuſed for their anceſtours ſake:</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
<note n="b" place="margin">Pravitas pattum filiis ſimilibus poenam adauget.</note> 
                  <hi>The wickedneſſe of parents increaſeth the puniſhment of like children,</hi> ſaith Theodoret. I anſwer, That all this ſpeaketh of temporal chaſtiſements, none of eternall horrour, infligible upon good children for the ſinnes of their parents. When God ſaith, <hi>I will viſit the ſinnes of the parents;</hi> if it implyed the viſiting them with like ſinnes, as it doth not; yet it is of them that hated him alſo, and by their perſonall hating him deſerved to have one ſinne puniſhed with an other: for the hatred of the ſonnes is meant, as annexed to the ſinnes of the fathers. This any one may ſee that will read Ezekiel 18.14. <hi>Lo, if a wicked man beget a ſonne that doth not like his father: he ſhall not die for the iniquitie of his father; he ſhall ſurely live,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>God hath no pleaſure that the wicked ſhould die,</hi> verſ. 23. And hath he delight that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall periſh eternally for his wicked anceſtours? The drift of the whole chapter is againſt it, and proveth his wayes to be equall: becauſe a wicked man repenting ſhall not die for his own tranſgreſſions, verſ. 25. &amp;c. And ſhall a righteous man die, or be condemned (for he meaneth the death of the ſoul) for the offences of others? <hi>Who ever periſhed being innocent? Even as I have ſeen, they that plow iniquitie, and ſow wickedneſſe, reap the ſame,</hi> Job 4.7, 8. and <hi>God rewardeth every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> not to the works of his forefathers, but according <hi>to his</hi> own <hi>works,</hi> Rom. 2.6. Mat. 16.27. which ſeemeth to be taken from the Pſalmograph, who aſcribeth to the Lord, not inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not ſeveritie, but grace and mercie in his judicature; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou rewardeſt every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his work,</hi> Pſal. 62.12.

If they mean as the words do ſignifie, let them ſay, that the matter of ſinne actuall is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, or the form, or both. The matter is the action, the form is the obliquitie thereof: both theſe do vaniſh. Doth the guilt of puniſhment paſſe over?

                  <hi>Guilt is a band joyning puniſhment &amp; ſin as a thing coming between them:</hi> And this band is rather in God, then in man, to tie or untie at his pleaſure.
<note n="d" place="margin">Actus qui jam tranſiit, dicitur manere quoad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum; non quia rectus ſit aliquid, ſed quia à ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li actu denominatur quis reus.

                  <hi>An act that is paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, is ſaid to remain in regard of the guilt; not that the guilt is any thing, but becauſe a man is denominated guiltie from ſuch an act. The guilt of ſinne is not any thing, ſince it is neither a ſubſtance nor an accident, but onely remains in the ſecret laws of God and mindes of Angels,</hi> as Holcot, <hi>De Imputab. pec.</hi> truely gathereth from S.

The guilt is not the perſonall ſinne it ſelf, but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof; and our queſtion is not now of the deſcent of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. Doth the guilt of ſinne take hold of the childe? they cannot ſay ſo, unleſſe here alſo they confound the effect with the cauſe: and this is but <hi>Petitio principii</hi> in other terms. Again, how heterodoxall is it, to ſay, <hi>A man begetteth a ſonne guiltie of all his actuall iniquities?</hi> For then, though the father may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his after-repentance, yet the ſonne who knoweth not perchance, nor ever heard inckling of his fathers horrid and ſecret ſinnes, (according to their poſition) may be damned for them. Do they mean, the ſtain and ſpot is communicated? I anſwer, The ſtain and ſpot is not the actuall ſinne, but the fruit of it inherent in the ſoul of the offender, and not tranſmiſſible by the bodie, and is onely metaphorically termed the ſtain, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no poſitive realitie tranſmiſſible. Zanchius himſelf relates their opinion thus,
<note n="e" place="margin">Peccatorum, quae aliquis parens committit, labem, &amp; ceu contagium juſto Dei judicio redundare in ejus corpus &amp; ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; per ejus porrò ſanguinem &amp; ſemen in filios, quos ex illo ſemine it à vitiosè affecto gignit, transfundi.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſpot and, as it were, contagion of the ſinnes which any parent committeth, doth redound, by Gods juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon his bodie and bloud, and is further transfuſed by his bloud and ſeed into the ſonnes whom he begets of that ſeed thus viciouſly affected.</hi> I anſwer, That <hi>[juſto Dei judicio]</hi> is brought in <hi>tanquam Deus aliquis è machina,</hi> to make things vaſt &amp; improbable ſeem likely &amp; paſſable: but the vain impertinencie of theſe words is eaſily obſervable by any, who knoweth that no manner of Gods judgements are any way unjuſt. Secondly, are not ſinnes of omiſſion perſonall ſinnes? and are they communicated to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6913:78"/>the bodie? Thirdly, what ſay you to pride of heart, and ſecret Atheiſme? Is the proud mans, and Atheiſts bodie and bloud infected with theſe prodigies? Again, If ſuch people be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven, and their ſinnes by repentance blotted out; are they now in their bodie, ſeed, and bloud, which are wiped out of their ſoul? and ſuppoſe he beget a ſonne between the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme and repentance; ſhall his childe be damned, while the repentant Atheiſt is ſaved? ſhould not he rather communicate his later repentance, then his former Atheiſme?</p>
               <p>But let us weigh the words a little nearer,
<note n="f" place="margin">Peccatorum, quae ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis parens committit, labes, &amp; ceu contagium, redundat in ejus corpus &amp; ſanguinem, &amp; per ejus ſanguinem &amp; ſemen in filios.</note> 
                  <hi>The blot and, as it were, contagion of ſinnes which the father commits, redounds upon his bodie and bloud, and by his bloud and ſeed to the ſonnes.</hi> What bloud is corrupted? all, or onely that which was made ſeed? and of ſeed, what ſeed? all ſeed, or onely that which is fruitfull? Suppoſe a father begets a ſonne with the ſeed which was in his bodie yer his ſinne was committed; how doth his ſinne viciate his bloud, or his bloud the preformed ſeed? If ſeed and bloud be properly vicious; then any ejaculation of ſeed, or letting of bloud, ſhould emptie people of their ſinnes or ſtains in them inherent; and ſinne ſhould no longer be a privation, but a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thing. Moreover, when they ſay, <hi>That by the fathers bloud and ſeed, the blot and, as it were, contagion is transfuſed into the ſonnes,</hi> they ſpeak without reaſon or ſenſe. For the blot and, as it were, contagion are transfuſed (if transfuſed at all) into the wombe of their mother, which hath a preexiſtence; and not into the children themſelves, who have no preexiſtence. The veſſell is before any thing can be poured into it; how then can ſinne be yoted by the fathers bloud &amp; ſeed into the childe that had no being? The laſt paſſage is this, <hi>The childrens bodies are firſt infected by theſe ſtains or actuall ſinnes, &amp; their ſouls after defiled by their bodies.</hi> If by the word <hi>infected</hi> they mean, really, truly, properly, and actually infected, I remit them to the place where I have proved, that the Embryo without a reaſonable ſoul is not, cannot be ſinfull: If they would be expounded of a pronitude to evil, or inclinations tending that way, when the ſoul is united; they have made much ado about nothing: a meer logomachy, retaining the old ſenſe, and uſing noveltie of terms. Again, if I ſhould yeeld, That the ſeed of one man is proner to one vice then an other, according to the vivid ſtrength and able diſpoſition of the parents, as (they ſay) ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards are more healthie, and more ſalacious then other people, as retaining part of that ſpiritfull vigour in which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; yet is originall ſinne the ſame in every one, alike in all parts and every way; and the likeneſſe to the parents in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is moſt remotely aſcribed to the ſeed, but properly to ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, as to the inward cauſe; and to the parents ill breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or to bad companie, or cuſtome, or to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6913:78"/>of their parents ſinne (which is a powerfull preſident in corrupt nature) as to the outward cauſe. For a wicked childe is as like a thouſand other wicked men, if not more like in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour then to his father; yet this proceedeth not from their ſeed, but from originall ſinne. But to the more diſtinct hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this point (this ſeventh and laſt Propoſition) Firſt, I will prove, That the perſonall ſinnes of all our forefathers, are not derived to us. Secondly, That not the ſinnes from the third and fourth generation are propagated. Thirdly, That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſinnes of our immediate parents are not transfuſed; And ſo it will ariſe of it ſelf, that no perſonall ſinnes are communicated. In the ſecond place I ſhall bring to light the authorities on our ſide. But before I begin either, let me briefly remove an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Bucer and Martyr teach (ſaith Zanchius) that by this doctrine the transfuſion of originall ſinne is more confirmed. I anſwer, That Gods truth hath no need of mans lie to uphold it. Cicero ſaid well,
<note n="g" place="margin">Perſpicuitas argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione elevatur.</note> 
                  <hi>Perſpicuitie is leſſened by argumentation:</hi> For what is more beleeved, more known to Chriſtians, then that originall ſinne is traduced? Weak arguments do often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice a good cauſe; and while Bucer and Martyr would ſeem to confirm that truth, which neither Jew, Turk, nor Chriſtian doubt of, let them take heed, leſt when they ſay actuall ſinnes are traduced, they give occaſion to the world to think, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſouls are not created, but traducted; &amp; ſo by conſequent, bring in the mortalitie of the ſoul. For it hath been confidently averred by learned men, That if the ſouls be traducted, they are mortall. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt branch, theſe arguments confirm it. If the actuall ſinnes of all our forefathers be communicated to their poſteritie; then they that are the more ancient are ſtill the better; and the laſt people of this world ſhall abſolutely, by nature, be worſt. But it is not ſo: for Pagans and Infidels now ſhould be many thouſand times worſe then the firſt infidels: which is not ſo, as is ſeen by experience. Secondly, then we might truely ſay, <hi>O happy Cain!</hi> happier by nature then Abel the righteous: (ſince Adam and Eve did manifoldly ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cains and Abels generations) yea, happier then Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the Patriarchs, juſt Job, and the Prophets, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Evangeliſts: ſince thou haſt fewer ſinnes to anſwer for then any in the world. Happier is all the drowned world in this regard, then the dayes ſince Chriſt. But to ſay ſo, is new Divinity. Therefore all ſinnes of actually tranſgreſſing parents are not communicated. Secondly, God dealeth not ſo rigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with mankinde, as he did with the devils: <hi>Verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but took on him the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Heb. 2.16. whereby he magnifieth Gods mercy to man, above that to the rebellious ſpirits: but he ſhould or did deal
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6913:79"/>worſe with mankinde, at leaſt with the damned, then with them, if all the perſonall ſinnes of our progenitours be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all us. For each of them bare onely but their own ſinnes, and none did beare one anothers ſinne further then they actually partaked with it. And this can not be otherwiſe: for both their ſinne was pride, and their nature uncapable of propagation, or communication of ſinne, unleſſe it be by reall and preſent conſenting or partaking. Laſtly, <hi>They all fell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſecond or third inſtant of their creation,</hi> ſaith the School. Suddenly the devil of <hi>Lucifer</hi> became <hi>Coluber;</hi> of <hi>Oriens, Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi> of <hi>Heſperus, Veſper. He abode not in the truth,</hi> Joh. 8.44. <hi>Satan fell from heaven like lightning:</hi> where lightning is not ſaid to fall from heaven; but he <hi>ſaw</hi>

                  </gap>, Luk. 10.18. <hi>Satan falling as ſuddenly from heaven, as lightning doth</hi> from the clouds on us; which is gone ere we can ſay it is come. Yea, not Satan alone, but the reſt of the Angels <hi>kept not their firſt eſtate,</hi> Jude verſ. 6. which Job thus varieth, <hi>God found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his Angels,</hi> Job 4.18. Seneca might well ſay of materials,

For there was no ſucceſſion of times in the ſinnes of any ſinning Angels: but as at once they were puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their place found no more in heaven; ſo at once almoſt they ſinned: nor did ſucceeding Angels beare their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours ſinnes or puniſhments: Therefore mankinde ſhall not do ſo neither.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, S. Auguſtine in his Enchiridion, chap. 47. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at this argument as unreaſonable, if they who have not the grace of regeneration, ſhould contract the ſinnes and beare the puniſhment of all their progenitours, from the beginning of the world; ſaying,
<note n="i" place="margin">Premerentur nimiâ ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinâ in aeterna ſua da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnatione.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhould be overburdened in their eternall damnation.</hi> But God puniſheth rather <hi>citra,</hi> then <hi>ultra condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum; rather leſſe, then more then we deſerve;</hi> and his mercie is above all his works. And as his wrath is to three or foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, ſo his mercie extendeth unto more, unto thouſands; but his mercie is not ſhewed unto more, if all our forefathers ſinnes lie upon us, unleſſe we can finde that there is ſomewhat more then <hi>all.</hi> Therefore mankinde contracteth not the ſinnes, nor ſuffereth the eternall puniſhments due to the ſinnes of all our parents.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The juſtice of God will not permit the ſame ſinne a million of times among many millions of perſons to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: but thus it muſt be, if Seth anſwer for Adam and Eves actuall ſinnes, and all Seths poſteritie to this day for every one of their predeceſſours ſinnes. Therefore <hi>all ſinnes of progenitours are not communicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This firſt branch receiveth ſtrength and confirmation from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6913:79"/>the ſecond, which is this, <hi>Perſonall ſinnes of our progenitours are not derived or communicated unto us from the third or fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much leſſe do they reach up to our firſt parents.</hi> Indeed the great S. Auguſtine in his Ench. chap. 47. makes this <hi>Quaere, Whether God threaten poſteritie with the ſinnes of their fathers, from the third and fourth generation; or threaten the fathers with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their poſteritie, becauſe his wrath extendeth no further, leſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſhould be overburdened: Or whether ſome other thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this buſineſſe, may, or may not be found by diligent ſearch of Scriptures, I dare not raſhly affirm.</hi> But I hope, without raſhneſſe, I may be bold to affirm, that God threatneth not to puniſh ſinne with ſinne in that place, but with other puniſhment. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, nor menaceth eternall puniſhments for the onely ſinnes of parents preceding: but onely the commination is of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments, if they be unlike their wicked parents; &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, if they be like in ſinne unto them. This being the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent meaning of the place, and the word <hi>viſito</hi> being ever taken to be ſynonymous with <hi>punio,</hi> or <hi>caſtigo,</hi> whenſoever it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traoppoſed to <hi>facere miſericordiam</hi> (as here it is) whereupon Gods judgement is called <hi>the viſitation of ſouls,</hi> Wiſd. 3.13. Pſal. 89.32. <hi>I will viſit their tranſgreſsion with the rod, and their iniquitie with ſtripes,</hi> or <hi>ſcourges.</hi> Let me in the third place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That though God puniſh poſteritie temporally, for the onely ſinnes of parents; and eternally, if wicked children reſemble their parents; yet it followeth not, that ſinnes are communicated to the third and fourth generation. For the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment may be juſtly inflicted on good children of wicked parents: and eternall is as juſtly inflicted on the evil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of an evil man; yet, rather as himſelf is evil, then as his parents were evil. Again, both the threat and the mercie are onely conditionall. Laſtly, if God ſhould ſtint the puniſhment alwayes at the end of the third or fourth generation, which he needeth not, and doth not; yet it followeth not that ſinnes are ſtinted at the third or fourth generation, or that, that is the prefixed period of time, to which the communication of ſinnes may be extended. But as in the words <hi>[unto thouſands]</hi> there is the uncertain for the certain, the indefinite for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, (for it is not expreſſed how many thouſands, either of men, or yeares, or generations) ſo in the words <hi>[the third and fourth generation]</hi> there is the certain for the uncertain, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite for the indefinite. And as God doth not tie himſelf to ſhew mercie unto the exact numbers of hundreds &amp; thouſands, ſo is he not reſtrained from puniſhing beyond foure generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But therefore the third and fourth generation is named, rather then any other, becauſe many a man now liveth to ſee his third or fourth generation flouriſh or decay: And therefore in our Liturgie, in the ſolemnization of marriage, the Prieſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6913:80"/>prayeth that the couple united may ſee their childrens children unto the third and fourth generations. And indeed, Job lived, after his great afflictions, to ſee <hi>his ſonnes, and his ſonnes ſonnes, even foure generations,</hi> Job 42.16. Again, Gregor. Moral. 15.22. interprets this of originall ſinne: and not onely the Vulgat, but the Hebrew hath it <hi>iniquitatem patrum,</hi> in the ſingular; and the third and fourth generation, (if ſo underſtood) <hi>hath reference to the ages of the world,</hi> ſaith
<note n="k" place="margin">Aug. Cont. Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cap. 7.</note> Auguſtine: from whom Procopius Gazeus little differeth upon the ſecond commandment, thus; <hi>Our Saviour ſaid ſomewhere, This generation ſhall not paſſe, till all theſe things be fulfilled,</hi> (the place is Mat. 24.34. accordingly Mat. 23.36. <hi>All theſe things ſhall come upon this generation) and truely he ſpake of the end.</hi> So he makes the fourth generation from Chriſts time to the end of the World; the third from the Law to Chriſt; the ſecond from Abraham to the Law (he ſhould have ſaid from the Floud to Abraham; for was not Noah and all his, till Abraham, part of humane generations?) the firſt from Adam to the Floud. And the oppoſite member, <hi>[ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercie unto thouſands]</hi> may be underſtood of millions of actuall offences forgiven. So much by the way for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>I return to the ſecond branch, <hi>Sinnes are not communicated to the third and fourth generation.</hi> For why not aſwell to the fifth and ſixth generations, and ſo downwards to the worlds end? Let ſome reaſon be ſhewed, why the force of communication of ſinnes ſhould reſt there. The place of Exodus intimateth not the communication of ſinnes, but the puniſhments; and the puniſhments ſo farre, becauſe many live ſo farre, and few far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the exemplarie ſinnes of fathers may be ſeen and remembred and followed by their fourth generation, and not further: and fathers dote not ſo much on their children, as grand-fathers and great-grand-fathers, nor cocker them up ſo much in evil. It is a ſenſeleſſe conſequence, That man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth ſinnes actuall, to the third and fourth generation, becauſe God puniſheth the ſinnes of the fathers upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the third and fourth generation, unleſſe they can prove, <hi>Whatſoever God puniſheth, man doth communicate unto man:</hi> which is impoſſible; for God ſometimes puniſheth ſuch ſinnes of the childe as the father never had, and of ſuch a childe as never had childe after, to whom he might communicate them.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt branch of the ſeventh and laſt Propoſition is this, <hi>That the immediate parents perſonall tranſgreſsions are not communicated to us.</hi> They may by way of puniſhment, by way of offence or ſinne they cannot. No one ſinne actuall is tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, propagated, transfuſed, communicated. If any one actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinne be derived, why not more? why not all, and every one?</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:6913:80"/>
               <p>Why ſhould the communication of ſinnes reſt in the father and mother, <hi>aſcendendo,</hi> when many children are liker their grand-fathers both in ſhape and feature, and in minde, and in vices, then to their father and mother, who were void of ſuch perſonall tranſgreſſions?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a true and old diſtinction, <hi>That original ſinne viciateth our whole nature, and actuall ſinnes infect the perſon.</hi> But this diſtinction is taken away and removed, if actuall ſinnes do viciate our nature, and are propagated by the ſeed, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſinne-originall. It is not called originall ſinne, for being the root of all ſinne, (for Satan ſinned firſt) but as it is in our nature originally. In this point Whitaker agreeth with Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>De originali peccato,</hi> 1.4. And there Stapleton worthily obſerves, that
<note n="l" place="margin">Originale peccatum differentiam ſpecificam notat, quae opponitur perſonali; deſignans cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam peccati naturam eſſe, non perſonam.</note> 
                  <hi>Original ſinne noteth a ſpecificall difference, which is oppoſed to perſonal; intimating that the cauſe of ſinne is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not the perſon.</hi> As when we mention <hi>actuall</hi> ſinnes, we make an oppoſition to ſinnes <hi>habituall,</hi> or to ſinnes of <hi>omiſsion,</hi> or to ſinne <hi>original.</hi> If perſonall ſinnes do paſſe over unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then Adams ſinne did ſo to his children. But not ſo. For it is but one ſingle ſingular ſinne which we ſinned in Adam.</p>
               <p>If Adams perſonall vices were propagated to Cain; were all, or part propagated? if part, what were thoſe? and why thoſe above others? if all, what did Adam traduce to Abel, Seth? &amp;c. Did he propagate onely thoſe ſinnes, which were committed between the generation of one and the other? And what ſinnes did Seth propagate to his poſteritie? Are perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinnes propagated alike to all the children? How is it that of one mans children, I have known one naturally exceeding angry, an other naturally ſtupid? Again, if a naturall fool beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one wiſe, what ſinnes doth he communicate? or on the contrary, a Machiavel begetteth a naturall fool; ſhall the fool be damned for his politick fathers malengin?</p>
               <p>If actuall ſinne be traduced; then, is it in the ſeed ere the ſoul come? in the ſeed in the fathers bodie? in the ſeed at the emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at the reception, and retention? Then millions of ſeeds ſpent in lawfull matrimonie, when women do not conceive; or what they have conceived, yet having no ſoul, ſhall have ſinne actuall: and if they have ſinne, they muſt come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But ſuch fruitleſſe disburdenings do not appeare in judgement. Again, if perſonall ſinnes be propagated, are they remitted in Baptiſme, or not? if remitted, how are they ſo like their parents afterwards? How can the ſeed, which is not ſo much as an humane body actually, but onely potentially, be actually ſinfull? If perſonall ſinne be communicated from the next parents, how is it that experience teacheth us, that very godly mens children are given to ſuch enormities, as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in their youth, middle-age, and old age have deteſted?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6913:81"/>It cannot come by communication of actuall ſinnes. You will ſay, it doth ariſe from ſinne original. So we ſay, and ſo do all ſinnes whatſoever ariſe from that corrupted fountain, that ever-bubbling wel-ſpring of evil, and not from a phantaſticall communication of actuall tranſgreſſions. If a meer Pagan and heathen, an idolatrous worſhipper of devils, beget two twinnes; ſhall they be alike wicked? We have heard and known the contrary. Gods diſcriminating ſaving grace doth not difference them, as you may ſay it doth in Chriſtians. Lot committed actuall ſinne, and knew it not; was that ſinne propagated to his ſonnes? That actuall ſinne ſhould be in the ſeed, which is but a ſuperfluity of nature, is very ſtrange. If Job had preſently, after that God had commended him to Satan, ſaying, <hi>There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil,</hi> Job 1.8. betook himſelf to the act of generation: or David at thoſe times, when he was a man according to Gods own heart: what perſonall iniquities had they propagated? Iſa. 56.5. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holy eunuchs God <hi>will give a place better, and name better then of ſonnes and daughters:</hi> yet, by this opinion, they of all other are moſt miſerable; for they receive all the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes of their fathers, and cannot waft-over either them or their own ſinnes into their children by their feed, (for they have none) but all muſt reſt in their ſouls, in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in their bloud, and upon themſelves onely.</p>
               <p>If God ſhould miraculouſly create a man and woman, not of the ſeed of Adam, and they blaſpheme God, and beget children; ſhall they transfuſe actuall ſinne, which have not original ſinne? or ſhall their children blaſpheme naturally? Or, if they be innocent themſelves from that great offence, ſhall they be damned for their parents blaſphemy?</p>
               <p>If perſonall ſinne be propagated, then the habits or acts. But neither. Not acts; for they are tranſient, and glide away. Not habits; for then, firſt, why ſhould not habits of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or goodneſſe, or the like be transfuſed, as well as of evil? eſpecially the habits of knowledge of evil? Secondly, then a childe is not onely originally ſinfull, by froward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; but habitually, by multiplied actions. Thirdly, habits belong to the perſon <hi>individuall,</hi> not to him as he is a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of mankinde: but propagation is according to the <hi>kinde</hi> or <hi>ſpecies,</hi> not according to the <hi>individuals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ye object, Ezek. 16.3. God chargeth them of Jeruſalem thus, <hi>Thy father was an Amorite, thy mother an Hittite;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he upbraideth them with their fathers ſinnes: I anſwer, Theſe words are not ſpoken of naturall deſcent, but of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children by imitation. For the Amorites and Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites were idolaters; and the Iſraelites who ſucceeded them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6913:81"/>in their inheritance, as children do fathers, inherited alſo their ſinnes, as appeareth in the whole chapter, eſpecially verſ. 44. <hi>Behold, every one that uſeth proverbs, ſhall uſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb againſt thee, ſaying, As is the mother, ſo is her daughter. Thou art thy mothers daughter, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the ſiſter of thy ſiſters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite. And thine elder ſiſter is Samaria, ſhe and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſiſter that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> The whole kindred is by imitation, not by nature. But our queſtion is of true conſanguinitie, and reall generation. Further, if the immediate parents of thoſe of Jeruſalem were idolaters, like to Amorites and Hittites; yet their ſinnes are related, as arguments the rather to deterre their children from the like, and to keep them from the temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which might juſtly be inflicted on them: but no way do the words intimate, that they ſhould be damned for their predeceſſours offences, unleſſe they continued in the ſame.</p>
               <p>A ſecond objection may be this: Gen. 9.22, 25. <hi>Cham the father of Canaan ſaw the nakedneſſe of Noah, and Noah curſed his grand-childe Canaan.</hi> I anſwer, That Cham or Ham had divers other children, to wit, Cuſh, Mizraim, and Phut, Gen. 10.6. and Noah curſed none of Chams children ſave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan onely. Upon which I conclude one of theſe two things; either that the curſe extended onely to things of this life; or that Canaan was partaker of his fathers ſinne. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the reſt of Canaans brethren muſt have been equally involved both in his guilt and in his puniſhment. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt, the words are Gen. 9.25. <hi>Curſed be Canaan; a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren.</hi> The other two might perchance, at diſtinct times, rule the one over the other; but Canaan ſhall be a ſervant, both to Shem, v. 26. and to Japheth, v. 27. To be <hi>a ſervant of ſervants,</hi> indeed was the curſe of Canaan; and it was really accompliſhed, when the Canaanites were made tributary and overcome, and the Gibeonites (a part of them) were made vaſſals to the meaneſt Iſraelites, which were the ofspring of Shem. Witty Epigrams and Paſquils have been made both againſt the citie of Rome and its Popes.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6913:82"/>was called Rome, when the ſinnes of that kinde were not hatcht or heard of; I ſay the inverted and averted name was rather witty and poſthumous, then ſound. Likewiſe they have this crochet againſt the Papal title of <hi>Servus Servorum,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Roma, tibi quondam fuerant Domini Dominorum:</l>
                     <l>Servorum ſervi nunc tibi ſunt Domini.</l>
                  </q> And Calvin derideth that Gregorian title. But the Abbot Rupertus well doth difference, that the Pope is not called abſolutely <hi>Servus ſervorum, The ſervant of ſervants;</hi> but <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus ſervorum Dei, The ſervant of the ſervants of God:</hi> to which I adde, that he is not ſaid to be <hi>Servus ſervorum fratribus ſuis, A ſervant of ſervants unto his brethren,</hi> which was the exact curſe of Canaan; but that he makes himſelf to be called <hi>Servus ſervorum filiis ſuis in Chriſto, A ſervant of ſervants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſonnes in Chriſt;</hi> from whom he imagined he took his name of <hi>Pater</hi> and <hi>Papa.</hi> The ſecond branch of my anſwer is, that Canaan was partaker of his fathers ſinne. That it might be ſo, is demonſtrable. For though Canaan was not born while Noah was in the ark, <hi>wherein few, that is eight ſouls, were ſaved by water,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.20. And thoſe eight ſouls were Noah and his wife, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their three wives, Geneſ. 7.13. yet Canaan was born unto Ham not long after the floud, Geneſ. 10.1, and 6, verſes. The Rabbins ſay, Canaan was ten yeares of age, and firſt ſaw his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers nakedneſſe, and in deriſion ſhewed it to his father; whereupon the father was curſed in that ſonne more then others. But that the innocent ſonne ſhould be curſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for the fathers offence, was never intended.</p>
               <p>A third objection may be this: Joh. 9.2. the Diſciples asked Chriſt, <hi>Who did ſinne, this blinde man, or his parents, that he was born blinde?</hi> From whence is inferred, that the Apoſtles beleeved, that the ſinne of parents is prejudiciall to the childe. I anſwer, The Apoſtles interrogation was grounded on knowledge, yet perhaps mixt with ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. They truely did know, both that bodily puniſhments are ſent of God upon men for their offences, and that a childe might juſtly be puniſhed corporally for the parents iniquitie. But their ignorance is ſeen in this, that they thought no puniſhment was inflicted, but for ſome ſingular ſingled noted offence. But for whoſe offence, or what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, there is the doubt which Chriſt thus untieth, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this man ſinned, nor his parents;</hi> (where he meaneth not that they had no particular ſinne, but not ſuch ſinne or ſinnes as for which this man was made blinde) <hi>but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> Secondly, this inſtance is ſo farre from proving the ſinnes of the fathers to be derived to their ſonnes, that it excuſeth both parents and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6913:82"/>children from ſuch and ſuch ſinnes. Thirdly, it hath appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reference to corporall puniſhments, which neither the Apoſtles nor I do deny, but they may juſtly be inflicted on the bodies or goods of children for their parents tranſgreſſions.</p>

Though Auguſtine alſo <hi>in Enchirid.</hi> be ſomewhat cautelous and timerous; yet otherwhere (as I have proved before) he is confident, that we ſhall ſtand forth to judgement for one onely ſinne of Adam, our originall ſinne: which truth he confirmeth in one particular, thus, againſt Julian the Pelagian 6.12.

               <p>Onely Vorſtius, of all the canvaſers of Bellarmine that I have met with, differeth from him and us, and maketh a double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, Generall, and Speciall: and ſaith, <hi>If Bellarmines drift be againſt the generall propagation, it is falſe; becauſe nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and experience witneſſeth,
<note n="r" place="margin">Corruptiores ex cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptioribus ordinariè ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerari.</note> that ordinarily worſe children are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of worſe men. If he ſpeak of the ſpeciall traduction, our men ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily aſſent unto him,</hi> ſaith Vorſtius. I reply on Vorſtius. Firſt, who ever before him talked of a double propagation? Not Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, nor Fathers, nor Councels. Secondly, is this generall propagation done at the ſame time that the ſpeciall is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed? Is this general propagation better or worſe then origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne? Is this generall propagation, of all ſinnes, and of all parents up to Adam, and of ſinnes repented of, and of ſinnes of omiſſion, and of tranſient ſinnes; or of ſuch as Atheiſme in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6913:83"/>ſoul, which hath ſmall, or no participation with the bodie? Let him define or deſcribe this trimtram of generall propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contra-oppoſed to the propagation of ſinne originall. But, ſaith he, <hi>Nature and experience ſay, Worſe children are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of worſe men.</hi> I anſwer, I never knew any worſe, then ſome children of ſome good men. Secondly, he puts <hi>non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> aſcribing the wickedneſſe of children to the propagation of actuall ſinne of their immediate parents, when he may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impute it to their hearing or beholding of their parents wickedneſſe, or to ill breeding and ill cuſtome. Thirdly, the vices of the immediate parents, and of the remoter, yea of the remoteſt, even from Adam, yea all the ſinnes that ever were committed, yea which yet never were committed, but ſhall be or may be hereafter, differing either in kinde or number from all ſinnes precedent, all have been, are, ſhall be (in regard of the beginning, root, and fountain) in originall ſinne. Fourthly, none ever that handled this controverſie (as Auguſtine, or the School) did ever take actuall ſinnes for inclinations to ſinnes. Fifthly, in Vorſtius his diſtinction there is a fallacie, viz. <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio principii,</hi> while he, without good proof, taketh that for granted which is the onely thing denied, namely, <hi>That there is an other propagation, beſides the propagation of ſinne originall.</hi> Sixthly, how inconſequentiall is this? <hi>Wicked men have ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily wicked children; Therefore perſonall ſinnes are propagated.</hi> But indeed we denie the antecedent, and ſay, The ſonnes of the wicked are as righteous, by naturall generation, as the ſonnes of the righteous.

                     <l>—de duro eſt ultima ferro:</l>
                  </q> The anſwer is expedite, Theſe are but poeticall fictions, ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe who knew no propagation of originall ſinne, and aſcribed this growing worſe and worſe to the depravation of manners then preſent in uſe, and to evil cuſtomes, rather then to the propagation of perſonall iniquities:
<q>Laudamus veteres, ſed noſtris utimur annis.</q> Much there is to the like purpoſe in heathen authours. Laſtly, Vorſtius himſelf, after his ſeeking to finde a knot in a bulruſh, after his needleſſe oppoſition in this point, concludeth thus, <hi>Hoc tranſeat, quia parvi momenti eſt; Let this paſſe, becauſe it is of ſmall moment.</hi> So that, even in his judgement, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6913:83"/>is ſmall, and indeed I think it not worth the name of a controverſie.</p>
               <p>When I had come thus farre, labouring to prove that <hi>no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or perſonall ſinnes are propagated,</hi> I caſually again conferred with that learned loving friend of mine, who formerly brought to my hand the opinions of the new Writers; and upon ſome diſcourſe, he ſetled on this expoſition, which otherwiſe he gave over as indefenſible, That they do mean by <hi>actuall ſinnes,</hi> that <hi>inclinations unto ſinnes are communicated.</hi> I anſwered, That I uſed to gather mens meanings by their words, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their words, nor the words of Zanchius the relatour, do incline to theſe inclinations. Again, never did any authour of any time before expound <hi>perſonalia,</hi> and <hi>actualia peccata</hi> (for of theſe muſt the queſtion be neceſſarily underſtood) by the <hi>inclinations unto ſinne.</hi> Moreover, if by <hi>peccata</hi> they did mean the <hi>proneneſſe unto ſinne;</hi> to avoid doubtfulneſſe, they ſhould, and as readily and eaſily they could (if they would) have written <hi>peccatorum inclinationes,</hi> as <hi>peccata</hi> in generall; or might have ſignified in ſome other words, and in ſome other paſſages, that they had meant ſo. This I know, They talk of <hi>peccata, peccata proximorum parentum,</hi> of <hi>labes peccatorum, &amp; ceu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagium;</hi> they have words enow, doubtfull and obſcure enough, which I dare ſay themſelves underſtood not when they writ, viz. <hi>peccatorum labes, &amp; ceu contagium:</hi> yet make they no mention of <hi>inclinations.</hi> But I would further know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their inclinations are derived unto their children, and puniſhed in them; which reſt onely as inclinations, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into act: Or ſuch inclinations as begin to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act, but are reſiſted and overcome by Gods grace: Or onely ſuch inclinations as breed actuall and perſonall iniquitie. If thus, then the inclinations are not puniſhed, but the actuall averſions. Or, are no inclinations derived from grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c? I, but ſince originall ſinne is alike in all, and ſome are more like to parents; whence doth this likeneſſe to them proceed more then to others? I anſwer, A drunkards childe is as like in that ſinne to all other drunkards, as to his father.</p>
               <p>But why hath a drunken father more commonly a drunken ſonne, then a ſober man? Firſt, that is not yet proved.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, parents ſinnes ſeen or heard of, eaſily invite the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to do the ſame. Thirdly, too many parents bring up their children to do as themſelves do. Fourthly, if a moſt drunken ſonne hath moſt ſober parents, then it comes from ſinne originall: Why not ſo alſo from drunken parents? If incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of drunkenneſſe be more in the ſeed of drunken men then of ſober, then the children of drunkards ſhould naturally be more drunk and deeper drunk, then any other drunkards whoſe parents were temperate. But that is not ſo, at leaſt not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6913:84"/>ſo naturally, becauſe not alwayes, no, nor perchance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly. Let me once more repeat, That all poſſible inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto ſinne are inveloped and involved in originall ſinne, which they either knew not, or conſidered not. Laſtly, when I had taken theſe pains to frame this chapter in defence of a point, which I never held to be queſtioned, it grieved me to heare my ingenious friend ſo much to defend the new Writers, and to dance after the new pipe. Candid and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable expoſitions I ſhall love while I live, and both uſe towards others, and deſire to be uſed towards me; but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, forced, farre-fetched interpretations (as this hath been) I can no way allow. For ſince reformation hath been ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, as to finde fault in all things, to eſteem the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as dunſes, (though they are thought dunſes that ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them) to account the Fathers as ſilly old men, or as children, (though they are but babes that admire them not) to diſregard Provinciall Councels, yea Generall Councels, as the acts of weak and ſinfull men (though they are the chiefeſt, the higheſt earthly-living-breathing Judges of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures controverſed;) which cavils againſt former times I have heard belched forth by the brain-ſick zealous ignorants of our times: ſince we have hiſſed out the Papiſts, and think they ſpeak againſt their own conſciences, when they maintain the infallibilitie and inerrabilitie of the Pope: May not Bucer and Martyr erre? Muſt all new opinions needs be true, and defended with might and main, with wreſted part-taking, over-charitable defenſes, rather then a ſmall errour ſhall be acknowledged? If ſuch milde dealing had been uſed againſt times precedent, we could not have found (as ſome now have done) about two thouſand errours of the Papiſts. But thus much (if not too much) ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice concerning theſe men and this matter, with this cloze, That Zanchius himſelf, in the place above cited, ſaith thus againſt that new-fangled opinion,

The great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, to keep the ſabbath, was given to ſonne and daughter, to ſervants and to ſtrangers, but not to the wife. She was forbidden in her husband, which the reſt were not, but dividedly: ſo was Eve forbid in Adam, not inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited her ſelf, but in him who repreſented her. The men of Iſrael repreſented the women, and the women had good by the actions or paſſions of the men. The females were redeemed in the males, every male gave a ranſome for his ſoul unto the Lord; all and every one, rich and poore alike, even half a ſhekel; and <hi>they gave this offering unto the Lord, to make an atonement for their ſouls,</hi> Exod. 30.15. Women were partakers of this benefit, and in the mens atonement was the womans comprized. Neither were the females pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Lord, but the males, the males onely: and the women in them, and by them, but not in their own perſons. In Gods due claim to the beaſts, theſe three conditions were to be obſerved: Firſt, that the beaſts ſhould be clean; and ſo not ſwine, not horſes, camels, dromedaries, elephants, or the like; but onely theſe three kindes, ſheep, ruther-beaſts, and goats, were the Lords (unleſſe you will make up the number, foure, with an aſſe; which was to be redeemed with a lambe, or his neck to be broken, Exod. 13.13.) For though it be ſaid Exod. 13.2. <hi>Sanctifie unto me all the firſt-born, whatſoever openeth the wombe among the children of Iſrael, both of man and beaſt: it is mine:</hi> Yet you muſt not extend the words to dogs, or cats, or things unclean, but onely to ſuch clean beaſts as God hath appointed for ſacrifices. Yea, though it be ſaid, Numb. 18.15. <hi>The firſtling of unclean beaſts thou ſhalt redeem:</hi> You muſt know, there is a double unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Firſt, that which is unclean throughout all its <hi>ſpecies;</hi> as ſwine, and horſes, and the like: Secondly, that which is unclean by accident, and is contra-oppoſed to perfect and unblemiſhed, Levit. 22.22, 23. as <hi>blinde, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or ſcurvie, or ſcabbed, — or which hath any thing ſuperfluous or lacking in his parts:</hi> ſuch beaſts, even of clean beaſts, as ſheep, goats, &amp;c. the Lord counted unclean, and claimed them not. Thoſe that were thus unclean by accident,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6913:86"/>were to be redeemed: and ſo that place of Numb. is to be underſtood, and not to be wire-drawn, as if God did claim the unclean beaſts to be his. The ſecond condition, That thoſe clean beaſts ſhould be firſt-born: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, and every firſtling that cometh of a beaſt,</hi> Exod. 13.12. Thirdly, theſe clean firſt-born or ſirſtlings muſt not be the females, though they firſt open the matrix, but the males; <gap reason="foreign">

For though it be ſaid in generall terms, Exod. 13.13. <hi>All the firſt-born among thy children thou ſhalt redeem;</hi> yet the women were not redeemed but in the men, and the men onely were offered. Luke 2.23. <hi>Every male that openeth the wombe ſhall be holy:</hi> Openeth the wombe by extramiſſion and ejection, not by intromiſſion and injection, as the Hebrew phraſe importeth: the Greek is thus, <gap reason="foreign">

But our late tranſlation, in both places aptly hath it <hi>the firſt-born,</hi> and not <hi>firſt-begotten.</hi> Though Jacob ſaith, Geneſ. 49.3. <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, thou art my firſt-born:</hi> yet Leah might have ſaid the ſame words as well; for he was the firſt-born of both: Yea, I dare ſay, if a man had more wives at once, as Jacob had; or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, as many others; the firſt male childe of each of theſe women by the ſame man may juſtly be called his firſt-born; and every one of theſe firſt-born children, if they had lived under the Leviticall law, had been conſecrated to God. And therefore Reuben having loſt his birth-right, the double portion which had been due to him, (and was due to the firſt-born under the law, Deut. 21.17. and was part of thoſe <hi>Jura primo-geniturae,</hi> and one of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> mentioned by the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.16.) was by Gods appointment, and Jacobs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6913:87"/>juſt allotment bequeathed to Joſeph, Geneſ. 48.5. And of him were two tribes, Ephraim and Manaſſeh: whereas no other of the children of Iſrael had more then one tribe. <hi>For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; but the birth-right was Joſephs,</hi> 1. Chron. 5.2. and not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs. For Joſeph was the firſt-born of Rachel, the firſt-love of Jacob, the firſt wife in the light, in right, and in intention: And ſo her eldeſt ſonne Joſeph was in right to be the firſt-born of Jacob: and her ſelf is prefer'd in place, not onely by Jacobs affection, but long after, by the Spirit of God, Ruth 4.11. <hi>The Lord make the woman like Rachel and Leah.</hi> Shall I ſtep one ſtep further? I may ſay, That if the willing and witting act of Jacob, preferring Ephraim, the younger ſonne of Joſeph, before his firſt-born Manaſſeh, did onely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that Gods bleſſing went not alwaies hand in hand by the prioritie of birth, and that God makes birth-rights according to his pleaſure, and not according to mans reckoning: Yet three other paſſages reach more home, to prove, That Joſeph was the firſt-born. Firſt, becauſe Jacob bleſſed Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph two ſeverall times, Geneſ. 48.16. and 49.22. which he did unto none of his other children beſides; and withall, he gave him <hi>one portion above his brethren, which he took out of the hand of the Amorite with his ſword and with his bow,</hi> verſ. 22. beſides the parcell of ground in Shechem, where Joſeph was buried; <hi>And it became the inheritance of the children of Joſeph,</hi> Joſh. 24.32. which was alſo a prerogative above his other brethren. Secondly, becauſe Jacob bleſſed Joſephs children before he bleſſed his own children, Geneſ. 48.16, &amp;c. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Jacob bleſſed both Joſeph in his children, and his children in his bleſſing; and bleſſed none of his childrens children, by name, ſeparately, and particularly, but Joſephs children onely (though divers of them had little ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jacob went into Egypt, Geneſ. 46.5.) and Joſeph him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Jacob bleſſed <hi>with the bleſsings of the breaſts, and of the wombe,</hi> Geneſ. 49.25. Which words, as they do promiſe a kinde of fruitfulneſſe; (which was taken from Ephraim, by barrenneſſe, when it was ſaid, Hoſea 9.14. <hi>Give them a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying wombe and drie breaſts)</hi> ſo I remember not, that ever the poſteritie of Joſeph had extraordinarie number of iſſue above other tribes, anſwerable to Jacobs extraordinarie bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but Judah, and his ofspring onely, had more men of warre, <hi>from twentie yeares old and upward,</hi> then both the tribes of Ephraim and Manaſſch, Num. 1.26, 33, 35. and therefore, in all likelihood, had more children from twentie yeares downward. Which words, I ſay, viz. <hi>The bleſsings of the breaſts, and of the wombe,</hi> as they may in a ſecond ſenſe imply a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ofspring; ſo in the firſt ſenſe, I conjecture, they point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6913:87"/>at the primo-geniture of Joſeph and his children. Sure I am, <hi>the birth-right was given to the ſonnes of Joſeph,</hi> 1. Chron. 5.1. and <hi>the birth-right was Joſephs,</hi> verſ. 2. and perhaps, even in this point, Jacobs bleſſings <hi>prevailed above the bleſsings of his progenitours,</hi> Geneſ. 49.26. For Abraham prayed once that his firſt-born ſonne, by his concubine, might be bleſſed: <hi>O that Iſhmael might live before thee!</hi> ſaith he to God, Gen. 17.18. and Iſaac would have bleſſed his firſt-born Eſau: <hi>Make me ſavourie meat, ſuch as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my ſoul may bleſſe thee before I die,</hi> ſaith Iſaac to Eſau, Geneſ. 27.4. though before-hand Eſau had ſold his birth-right unto Jacob, Geneſ. 25.33. Neither Abraham, nor Iſaac prevailed in their wiſhes: but Jacobs bleſſings prevailed above the bleſſings of his progenitours, becauſe, whom he deſired to bleſſe, God bleſſed; and he gave, by Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, the primo-geniture to Joſeph whom he loved, and to whom, in ſome regard, it was due before Reuben.</p>
               <p>I return to the old matter, and opine, That when a batcheler marrieth with a widow, which had had a ſonne by her former husband, her firſt man-childe by the ſecond husband was not a firſt-born, nor ſo accounted in the law. And if after a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had had ſeven husbands, and daughters onely by each of theſe, ſhe had been married alſo unto the eighth husband, and ſhould have a ſonne by him, though he had had divers ſonnes before by other women; yet this his ſonne by this woman is, in the eye of the law, a right firſt-born childe, and ſacred to the Lord; and to be redeemed, not with the generall redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of every male, half a ſhekel, of which I ſpake before, but with the particular redemptions of the firſt-born. Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were of two ſorts: the firſt is expreſſed Numb. 3.45. where <hi>the Levites are taken in ſtead of all the firſt-born, and the cattell of the Levites in ſtead of their cattell.</hi> And becauſe there were two hundred and ſeventy more of the firſt-born ſonnes of the Iſraelites, then all the male Levites came unto, every one of thoſe odde 270 paid five ſhekels to the Lord for their redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: which ſumme of five ſhekels was ever after, during the Law, the price of the redemption of the firſt-born ſonne, Numbers 18.16; which was the ſecond kinde of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit to ſhew the means which God uſed, to prevent the coſenage about things conſecrated. They were to do no work with the firſt-born bullock, nor to ſhear their firſt-born ſheep, Deuter. 15.19.</p>
               <p>It is alſo remarkable, firſt, that Pharaoh commanded the midwives of the Hebrews, Exod. 1.16. <hi>If it be a ſonne, ye ſhall kill him:</hi> and gave in charge after to all the Egyptians, his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Every ſonne that is born ye ſhall caſt into the river, and every
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6913:88"/>daughter ye ſhall ſave alive,</hi> verſ. 22. Secondly, that Moſes was the ſonne of a Levite, expoſed to the danger of the water; and therefore called Moſes, becauſe he was drawn forth, Exod. 2. and after called by God, to revenge this wrong and others upon Pharaoh. Among which plagues, this was a great one, to ſlay their firſt-born: and as the juſt retaliation uſed by God in other things, yea in this, was, not to deſtroy their daughters, but their ſonnes; ſo in his mercy he would not deſtroy all their males, but the firſt-born onely; which you muſt not underſtand of their daughters, though they were firſt-born, but onely of their males. For when it is ſaid, Pſal. 78.51. <hi>He ſmote all the firſt-born in Egypt, the chief of their ſtrength;</hi> you cannot imagine that women were the chief of their ſtrength, but the men onely. And God taught the people to ſay, Exod. 13.15. <hi>The Lord ſlew all the firſt-born, &amp;c. therefore I ſacrifice unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, being males.</hi> And as the firſt-born males onely were ſacrificed, ſo onely were the firſt-born males re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. And accordingly all the male Levites were taken for the male firſt-born of Iſrael: and at the moſt righteous maſſacre of the firſt-born males of Egypt, the Iſraelites eſcaped by the bloud of a lambe without blemiſh, <hi>a male of the firſt yeare,</hi> or a ſonne of the firſt yeare, Exod. 12.5. From whence you may ſee the groſſe errour of Cornel. Cornelii à Lapide, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That if a woman had had a daughter firſt, and ſonnes after, her firſt ſonne had not been her firſt-born, but her daughter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe opened the matrix firſt: when it is evident, that if a woman had had many daughters before one ſonne, yet her firſt ſonne was her firſt-born in the Law. And God ſaith, Exod. 12.24, <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve this thing for an ordinance to thee, and to thy ſonnes for ever:</hi> viz. the ordinance of keeping the Paſſeover. I recollect, &amp; apply theſe things thus, The men of Iſrael repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the women; The firſt-born ſonne, and not the daughter, was the Lords due; The male Levites were in ſtead of the firſt-born ſonnes; All firſt-born males were redeemed; Women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good by the mens circumciſion, and by mens redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was in one kinde or other, whether they were firſt-born or not firſt-born. And though the deviliſh ſuperſtition of the Turks now circumciſe women (as Joannes Leo report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) yet by Gods appointment women were neither to be circumciſed, nor redeemed, but as they were in men, and as men repreſented them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let me come yet nearer to the main purpoſe. The Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Corinth. 12.26. <hi>Whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi> From whence I thus argue; As at the committing or deed-doing in murder, the murderers hand may be ſaid to will the murder; not becauſe there is any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6913:88"/>will, ſtrictly taken, belonging to the hand; or becauſe there is ſinne properly in the right hand, which doth but its duty in obeying the ſouls domineering diſpoſition, or <hi>dominium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoticum:</hi> but becauſe the hand is part of that man, in whoſe ſoul the will was that commanded the murder; and becauſe the ſoul is <hi>principium totius individui,</hi> the fountain from which all members take life, and uſe motion, and by the ſoul the motion was derived to all the other parts of the body. So were we, and every one of man-kinde, willing to commit the ſinne with Adam; not as if we had been there actually to agree or diſagree, but as we were parts of him who was the fountain of humane nature, which conveyed corruption unto all mankinde. Semblably in the puniſhment: though the right hand onely give the blow, and actuate the murder, yet upon the delinquents apprehenſion both hands are pineoned, both feet fettered, the neck is haltered, and the whole body rueth it; yea, ſoul and all, without repentance. So, though Adam onely ſinned that firſt great ſinne, yet becauſe he did it repreſenting us, Adam alone is not puniſhed for it: but we that are bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, all that are members of the firſt Adam are guilty of the fault, and condignely are puniſhed, if we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant. For as the divers members of a body, are part of the perſon of one man: ſo all and every man is, as it were, a part and member of humane nature. And thus by the participation of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> more men are one; and one, more: we, Adam; and Adam was we. But let us go out of man himſelf, and look to other faſhions of the world, in matters politicall. Do not the ſeverall men in a Townſhip or Corporation make one body thereof, and the whole Corporation is, as it were, but one man? and what a few do, is it not the act of all? of which he complained, who ſaid, <hi>That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Maior, for his own particular, was an honeſt man, and ſo were all the brethren, who promiſed him fairely; but</hi> (becauſe, contrary to their promiſe, they pinched upon him) <hi>the Corporation was a knave.</hi> Doth not the Houſe of the Commons repreſent the Body of the Realm, in the Parliament time, though the thouſand part of the ſubjects be not preſent? and what they enact, the abſent enact; what they deny, the abſent deny: and what immunities and priviledges they obtain, for ſucceſſion as well as for themſelves they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them: and what ſervices, tributes, ſubſidies, or taxes they yeeld unto, all the reſt of the Realm muſt yeeld unto, and pay: yea, by the truſt repoſed in them, they binde or looſe the whole Kingdome, ſometimes in ſuch things as others would never have conſented unto, and yet muſt undergo, and ſee performed. In the fifth book of the Hiſtorie of Portugal, the Univerſitie and Divines of Alcala, among other things, truely decreed, and religiouſly guided Philip the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6913:89"/>ſecond towards the attaining of the crown of Portugal, in theſe words, ſaying, that, <hi>When as Common-wealths do chooſe their firſt King, upon condition to obey him and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, they remain ſubject to him to whom they have tranſferred their authority; no juriſdiction remaining in them either to judge the realm, or the true ſucceſſour, ſeeing in the firſt election all true ſucceſſours were choſen.</hi>

Much more did Adam repreſent our perſons, when, what he willed and performed, we willed and performed; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, as many waters in a fountain; all to be corrupted, if he were corrupted; all to be pure, if he continued pure; all to live by his righteouſnes, all to die by his iniquity.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in the famous battell between the three Horatii and the three Curiatii, did not they repreſent both the armies and both the people? the Horatii, of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes? the Curiatii, of the Latines? Did not their wills, their ſtrength, their fortune depend on the wills, ſtrength, and fortune of thoſe combatants? did not the Latines fall into ſubjection by the death of the Curiatii? and did not the Romanes thrive and proſper by the valour of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Horatius? Yea in the Scripture, long before this battell, <hi>there went out a champion out of the camp of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, Goliath of Gath,</hi> 1. Sam. 17.4. with a proud challenge, and bold defiance; <hi>Am not I a Philiſtine, and you ſervants of Saul?</hi> Then he articleth, <hi>Chooſe you a man for you, and let him come down to me. If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me; then we will be your ſervants: but if I prevail, and kill him; then you ſhall be our ſervants, and ſerve us.</hi> It ſhould ſeem, the Philiſtines referred themſelves to his ſucceſſe; for when David had undertaken the duel, and <hi>when the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines ſaw their champion dead,</hi> (they fought not a ſtroke) <hi>they fled.

Likewiſe when Chriſt ſaid to him, Matth. 16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the keyes of heaven: and whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven: whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> And when this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Peter was promiſed to the reſt of the Apoſtles alſo, Matth. 18.18. and when both theſe promiſes were fulfilled and accompliſhed, as they were after Chriſts reſurrection (and not before) and authoritie given, and by a ſolemne ceremony exhibited by Chriſt, not onely to S. Peter, but to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Apoſtles, ſaying, Joh. 20.21, &amp;c. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you. And when he had ſaid this, he breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt. Whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſinnes ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Did not the Apoſtles repreſent the whole body of the Miniſtery? unleſſe you will fable, that in the Apoſtles dayes they had more need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, then we have now; or that Chriſt loveth not his Church now, nor affordeth the like means of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reconciliation, as he did in thoſe times. But by the ſame deceitfulneſſe of cavillation, you may ſay as well, that when Chriſt brake bread, and gave it to his Diſciples, and ſaid, <hi>Take, eat; this is my body: and gave the cup to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it;</hi> none but they might eat, or drink the Supper of the Lord. But it is undeniable, that when Chriſt ſaid to his twelve Apoſtles, Luk. 22.19. <hi>This is my body which is given for you: Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> he ſpake it to them as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentours of the whole Prieſthood onely: who onely have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to conſecrate the body and bloud of our Lord.

Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy 5.22. and Titus 1.5. Act. 20.28. But other Fathers extend the compariſon between the Apoſtles and Biſhops to other matters; appropriating to the Biſhops, above the Presbyters, the power of Confirmation, and divers other things. All which though we grant, yet no man will deny but for preaching, baptizing, and eſpecially for conſecrating of the Euchariſt, and Sacerdotall Abſolution, or Miniſteriall Remiſſion of ſinnes, the Apoſtles repreſented not the people
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6913:90"/>in any wiſe, nor the Biſhops onely; but the univerſall body of Chriſts Miniſters.</p>
               <p>And do not, among us, the Right Reverend Arch-biſhops, and Biſhops, and the Clergy, aſſembled in the Convocation, repreſent the whole Church of England? are not they our Nationall Councel? do not their Articles of Religion binde in conſcience all and every one of the Church of England, as much, if not more then Civill laws? Nor is there the like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority on earth, for the ſetling of our conſciences in matters of Scripture, or Scriptures controverted, or to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, as the externall publick breathing voice of a true Oecumenical Councel of the Patriarchs, Biſhops, and choice Divines of the Chriſtian world. The eſſentiall, univerſall Church of Chriſt is (and we muſt beleeve it is) <hi>the houſe of God, the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> 1. Tim. 3.15. It never erred, it cannot erre, its iudgement is infallible. <hi>The Spirit leadeth</hi> this Church <hi>into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. Of the Church of God, conſiſting of the faithfull in any one age or time, I dare ſay, it never did erre damnably, or perſiſted in ſmaller errours obſtinately; but alwayes ſome truly maintained things neceſſary to ſalvation: and unto this fluctuant militant part of the Church, Chriſt hath promiſed to be with it <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> Matt. 28.20. The whole viſible Church at no time can fall into hereſie; but ſome ſeek after the truth, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and profeſſe it.

               <p>Of the repreſentative Church of Chriſt in Councels, this may be ſaid truly and ſafely: viz.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſix Generall Oecumenicall Councels, not one, <hi>de facto,</hi> erred in any definition of matters of faith. Of other lawfull general Councels, that may hereafter be called, though I will not deny but they may poſſibly be deceived, as they are men, and therefore are not free from errability: (but if ſuch Councels may erre, or pronounce amiſſe, cannot coblers?) yet there is leaſt likelihood of their erring. Such Oecumenical Councels have the ſupremeſt, publick, externall, definitive judgement in matters of Religion; if any oppoſe them, they may not onely ſilence them, but cenſure them with great cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and reduce them into order.

Was ever Scripture made ſuch <hi>a noſe of wax?</hi> did ever any religious heart think, ſuch could be the meaning of thoſe words? Let me but touch at her obſcene expoſition of the end of Chriſts Circumciſion, pag. 5; and conſider her fanaticall imagination, that the Spirit of God by Michael underſtood King James, pag. 50: And the warre in heaven with Michael and his Angels, againſt the Dragon and his Angels, is thus expounded by her, pag. 55. <hi>The fray is fought by ſeconds: by Michael is meant King James; the Dragon is the Pope, whom Michael overcame by the bloud of the Lambe, and by the teſtimonie of ſo many Biſhops, and other faithfull, crowned with the glory of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6913:92"/>Martyrdome:</hi> whereas King James had never a Biſhop ſo crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and never a Biſhop was ſo crowned ſince he was born. Holy, peaceable, and harmleſſe King James, who would ſcarce hurt a worm, is now interpreted to be the greateſt fighter among the celeſtiall hoſt.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh ſhe would repent for her blaſphemy, pag. 70, where ſhe writeth, <hi>That the perſon of the ſonne of God</hi> (not made) <hi>was turned into a lump of clay:</hi> and for her pointing out the day of judgement. For though ſhe confeſſeth, pag. 90, <hi>Of the day &amp; houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor the Sonne, but the Father;</hi> yet ſhe addeth, <hi>The account of this book of note is by centuries of yeares.</hi> Suppoſe it were ſo, (as it is not) could not Chriſt and his Angels know the day by the computation of centuries, as well as ſhe? but ſhe, by a new account, hath found out (as ſhe imagineth) what Chriſt and the good Angels were ignorant of, namely, the exact day of doom. For thus ſhe determineth, pag. 100, <hi>There is nineteen yeares and a half to the day of judgement, July the twenty eighth one thouſand ſix hundred twenty five.</hi> Had not this woman been better never to have ſeen Scripture, then thus to profane it, and take Gods word in vain? You think you have the Spirit of God, as you write in the laſt page: but I am ſure, if you repent not betimes, for your wire-drawing of Gods word, and intruding into hidden and unſearchable depths of Divinitie; you are in a deſperate caſe, and all the Separatiſts and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts of the Nether-lands, where they ſay your book was printed, cannot defend you.

Hieroms authority give authority or allowance to this mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mangle-kinde of interpretation: his authority in this point being weakened by his ſlender conjecture. <hi>I think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Prophet Jeremy did prudently conceal the name of Babel, leſt the beſiegers of Jeruſalem ſhould be enraged againſt him:</hi> but (ſay I) otherwhere he nameth <hi>Babel,</hi> as Jeremy 50.18. and layeth a burden upon the kingdome and citie of Babylon, upon her Princes and her wiſe men, both in the 50 and 51 chapters. Yea in the ſame 25 chapter, ver. 12, Jeremy ſaith from God, <hi>I will puniſh the king of Babylon, and that nation.</hi> Which inconvenience Lyra foreſeeing, therefore, perhaps, the rather thinketh, that <hi>Sheſhach</hi> is the name of the Egyptian King, and that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the common name; as afterward <hi>Ceſar</hi> was the common name of the Emperours, and <hi>Julius</hi> a proper name. This is evident, there was a <hi>Sheſhach,</hi> king of Egypt in the dayes of Solomon, 1. King. 11.40. and there might alſo be a ſecond <hi>Sheſhach</hi> after. But Lyra himſelf on Jer. 51.41. ſaith, that <hi>Sheſhach</hi> in that place is uſed for <hi>Babel;</hi> and I am forced to ſay, that no part of the 51 chap. toucheth on the woes of Egypt, but purpoſely is bent againſt Babylon; and it is not likely that the ſame Prophet would call two diſtinct kings, or two diſtinct kingdomes by the ſame word <hi>Sheſhach.</hi> Therefore Lyra is out of tune in this ſtrain. But why then is <hi>Sheſhach</hi> put for <hi>Babel?</hi> If no reaſon could be aſſigned, yet the word of God is not ſo to be dandled withall, or rather to be tortured, as to draw expoſitions out of anagrams; and therefore the Jeſuit was juſtly blameable, to make this place a pattern of his anagrammatiſticall interpretation.

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:6913:93"/>and ſo may ſignifie, either <hi>the King,</hi> or <hi>the City, keeping a feſtivall day:</hi> Which was never without feaſting. Now that both the feaſt was kept, and the feſtivall day deſigned to the worſhip of their idols, may be judged by the event, Daniel 5.4. where <hi>they praiſed the gods;</hi> and for ſo doing was Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar reprehended, verſ. 23. Tremellius addeth, that Jeremy by this one word did demonſtrate with his finger the very day of the King of Babel, and Babylons fall; as if he had ſaid, <hi>At a feaſt he ſhall be ſlain,</hi> or, <hi>In her feaſting the city ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> For as the Lord propheſied by Iſaiah, <hi>Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink,</hi> Iſa. 21.5. where both the feaſt, and the fall of the King of Babel, and of the city alſo is divinely foretold: ſo God gave a ſecond warning, Jeremy 51.39. <hi>In their heat I will make their feaſts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoyce, &amp; ſleep a perpetuall ſleep.</hi> Where Babylons feaſting-deſtruction is named; then followeth, <hi>I will bring them down like lambes to the ſlaughter,</hi> ver. 40. whereupon he crieth out in the 41. ver. <hi>How is Sheſhach taken?</hi> that is, <hi>Diem feſtum celebrans,</hi> either <hi>the feaſting Belſhazzar,</hi> or, <hi>the feaſting city overthrown?</hi> Concerning the King, the Scripture ſaith, Daniel 5.1. <hi>He made a great feaſt to a thouſand of his lords, and drank wine; and whiles he taſted the wine, he commanded to bring the golden and ſilver veſſels of the temple of Jeruſalem; and in the ſame houre the fingers of a mans hand wrote his deſtruction; and that night was he</hi> (the wine-bibbing Sheſhach) <hi>ſlain.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the city, I proved before out of Jeremy, that her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was to wait upon her intemperance; and ſo, <hi>Quomodo capta eſt Sheſhach, id eſt, Civitas diem feſtum celebrans?</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I rather incline to this latter expoſition, in this place, becauſe alſo of the words immediately following, <hi>How is the praiſe of the whole earth ſurpriſed?</hi> (but neither Belſhazzar, nor Sheſhach, if it were an idol, were the praiſe of the whole earth) <hi>How is Babylon become an aſtoniſhment among the nations?</hi> If you judge it to be a ſhe-idol, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo capta eſt Sheſhach?</hi> I firſt anſwer, that at that feaſt ſervice was done to many idols of gold and ſilver, braſſe and iron, wood and ſtone, Daniel 5.23. but that Sheſhach was the chief among them, or that any one idol of them was ſo named, is yet to be proved. Therefore the other anſwer may ſtand good, that there is no neceſſitie of making the word <hi>Sheſhach</hi> to be the proper name of King, City, or Idol: it may rather be an appellative. For Jeremy 25.26. <hi>Rex Sheſhach bibet poſt eos:</hi> which (as I ſaid) you may interpret, <hi>Rex diem feſtum celebrans bibet poſt eos, The King celebrating a feſtivall day, ſhall drink af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them;</hi> though Tremell. hath it thus, <hi>Rex Babyloniae feſta haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis bibet, &amp;c.</hi> I cannot deny, but if there were ſuch an idol among them as was termed <hi>Sheſhach,</hi> (which is our main
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6913:94"/>enquiry, yet unproved) it might, as well as <hi>Bel, Merodach,</hi> and <hi>Melcom,</hi> ſignifie the people which worſhipped it. Till that point be evidenced, I will ſay with Tremellius, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to name the King, or veiling the name of the city, and deſcribing him or it by what was propheſied they ſhould be doing or acting, (as indeed it fell out) is to be referred <hi>ad</hi>

Sam. 25.25. <hi>Nabal is his name, and folly is with him:</hi> and Jeruſalem is called <hi>the holy city,</hi> for the holy things there done, there contained. I conclude thus, If anagrammes from the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack, or Greek, languages in which the words of holy Scripture were writ, may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (as indeed they may not;) much leſſe may we expound the ſacred Originall by Engliſh anagrammes, the flaſhes and fire-works of luxuriant brains.</p>

And ſhall God give us a law concerning our ſouls, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the interpretation of it to every one?

               <p>Yea, but the Bereans <hi>received the word with all readines of minde, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo,</hi> Acts 17.11. Shall they examine the very Apoſtles doctrine, and not we the doctrine of our Paſtours? I anſwer, firſt, Theſe Bereans were learned and eminent men. But every unlearned skullion now, that hath skill onely in the Engliſh originall, will conteſt with the profoundeſt Clerks. Secondly, theſe Bereans were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers before the examination of thoſe things: for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately it followeth, <hi>Therefore many of them beleeved, and many honourable Greek women and men.</hi> Art thou an unbeleever?

               <p>I confeſſe, that the judgement of the Scripture and Creed is onely authentick, and perfectly deciſive. And if we could exactly hit on the true meaning, all differences were quickly at an end. Nor do I monopolize learning to the Clergy, when I confine and reſtrain the judgement of learning to the learned.

Peter, James, and John did ſee more then the reſt of the Apoſtles, and were commanded to conceal the Tranſfiguration, even from the reſt of the Apoſtles. <hi>Tell the viſion to no man, untill the Sonne of man be riſen again from the dead,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to them, Matth. 17.9. and yet the knowledge of the Tranſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was none of the neceſſary points to ſalvation. Chriſt at firſt taught obſcurely as it were by ſhadows and reſemblances: both his death by the amphibolous words, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple,</hi> Joh. 2.19. and his reſurrection and aſcenſion, by inſtancing in the type of the braſen ſerpent lifted up, Joh. 3.14.

               <p>Queen Eliſabeth alſo ſhewed her diſlike in Parliament, March 29. in the 27 yeare of her reigne (in Stows Chronicle, pag. 702) ſaying, <hi>I ſee many overbold with God Almighty; making too many ſubtile ſcannings of his bleſſed will; as Lawyers do with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtaments.

As I would not have the people, with the Papiſts, as it were, to hoodwink and cover their eyes, that they may be led by others; and glory in blinde obedience, which little differeth from wilfull, and ſtupid ignorance; but adviſe them to unmuffle their heads, and open their own eyes, and judge of things which they do or can know, &amp; are skilfull to judge: (but
<note n="z" place="margin">Ignorantia in Jadice aequiparatur dolo.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignorance in a Judge is as bad as injuſtice,</hi> and a ſimple unlearned Judge is a miſchief, as intolerable, as unheard of) ſo do I wiſh the people, to avoid the other extream of Separatiſts; who thinking they know all things, though they have no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inſpiration, will ſeem wiſer then their teachers; and taking up opinions for truth, and malepert obſtinacy for humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, diſrepute their Paſtours, diſregard all authority, and aſcribe nothing to that ſovereigne generall commiſſion, <hi>He who

               <p>Oh but men are men; and as men, may erre. I hope, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned people are not Angels, nor more free from errour then the learned. Yet we muſt be led by our conſciences. True; and your conſciences even therefore ought the rather to be well grounded, and founded; not upon the ſlippery ſand of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but on knowledge, as on a ſure and ſafe rock. And in whom ſhould knowledge reſide, if not in your Paſtours?</p>
               <p>But in Queen Maries daies ſhould a man have been led by his Paſtours, when themſelves were at ods, and the greateſt part awry? Or how ſhould a true Proteſtant, and now a ſubject of Spain, in Spain behave himſelf? How much is left to his power of diſcretion, when the whole Eſtate, both Eccleſiaſtick and Civil, runneth with a torrent the contrary way? If he be led by his conſcience, and oppoſe them; there followeth (with the hideous, ſecret, moſt feared, and affrighting torments of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition) confiſcation of goods, and ſometimes ſhamefull, commonly a painfull and violent death. If he rely on the advice of the Paſtours, he ſinneth againſt his own conſcience, and againſt truth. Who can, or will direct this wavering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in ſuch uncertainty of wayes, that he ſtep not aſide, nor be out of the right path?</p>
               <p>O gracious God, <hi>ſend out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me,</hi> Pſal. 43.3. Let them direct my diſcourſe, and illuminate it; that it may be to the anxious and ſcrupulous conſcience as a guide, to direct the way; and as a lanthorn, to give it light in the way.</p>
               <p>S. Hierome and Ockam, and Doctour Field, (of the Church 4.13.) three moſt eminent in three ages (a Father, a Schoolman, and a pillar of our Church) do counſel good men, in ſuch a caſe, to ſilence and mourning in ſecret, as the Prophet Jeremy did: <hi>Men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have nothing left unto them, but with ſorrowfull hearts to referre all unto God.</hi> I ſhould rather, under correction, ſay, That a Chriſtian thus perplexed is to take theſe courſes, which thoſe Divines, perhaps, did preſuppoſe as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary preparatives, but did not expreſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I adviſe that man, whoſe conſcience runneth a ſingular way, <hi>to waſh his heart from wickedneſſe,</hi> Jerem. 4.14. <hi>to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty:</hi> which is pointed at, as a means whereby men may come to the knowledge of the truth, 1. Tim. 2.2. &amp;c. For <hi>unto the wicked God ſaith, What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in thy mouth?</hi> Pſal. 50.16. Ezek. 20.3. Yes, but <hi>thou art confident that thou thy ſelf art a guide of the blinde, a light of them
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6913:96"/>which are in darkneſſe, an inſtructer of the fooliſh, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.10. I anſwer, Thou muſt alſo take the qualifications and neceſſary appendants to a reformer, following in that place immediately: <hi>Thou therefore that teacheſt an other, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? &amp;c.</hi> Thy ſelf muſt not be ignorant, thy ſelf muſt not ſteal, not commit adultery, not commit ſacriledge, not break the Law, not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God. For, as it is Wiſd. 1.5, 6. <hi>The holy ſpirit of diſcipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without underſtanding, and will not abide where unrighteouſneſſe cometh in. For wiſdome is a loving ſpirit.</hi> Never were the uncharitable, ignorant, or ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, fit undertakers to contradict eſtabliſhed doctrines, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplines, or commonwealths. But, <hi>Thou hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye; and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy brothers eye,</hi> Matth. 7.5. Reaſons more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary will be expected by God and good men from him who leapeth out of the Church in which he was born and bred, kicking at the breaſts of his mother, running with the bit in his teeth his own wayes. I conclude this firſt point thus; <hi>He who will needs runne ſuch ſingular courſes, had need be a man of rare ſanctity, and of ſingular good endowments of knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I would have him earneſtly to pray for humility, and to practiſe it. By pride Satan caſt himſelf out of heaven; Adam him and his out of Paradiſe. David ſaid, Pſal. 131.1. <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty,—neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great matters, or in things too high for me.</hi> And verſ. 2. <hi>Surely I have quieted my ſoul as a childe that is weaned of his mother: my ſoul is even as a weaned childe.</hi> On which words, ſuffer me to make a little excurſion, by way of explanation.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt paſſage: If David had appealed to men, ſome ſcruple might have remained: but ſaying to God the ſearcher of hearts and reins, <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty;</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his humility unqueſtionable.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>Jurans &amp; nominans; He that ſweareth and nameth God:</hi> Where the Vulgat and Septuagint omit the name of God; though it be neceſſarily underſtood, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our beſt tranſlation.</p>
               <p>In the laſt paſſage, remember that we ought all, in this point of humilitie, to be <hi>as little children,</hi> if we will <hi>enter into the kingdome of heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.3. David addeth, <hi>My ſoul is as a weaned childe:</hi> not in this reſpect, that newly weaned children are commonly more froward: (ſimilitudes hold not in every particular) but as the mother applieth muſtard, wormwood, and other bitter things, to her breaſts, that ſhe may keep her childe from the milk which he deſireth; though ſhe know it inconvenient, or hurtfull for him: ſo God did wean David, by the bitter remembrances of death, fear of Gods judgement, and the pains of hell; and by croſſes alſo of this life, ſickneſſe, baniſhment, envy in court, inſurrection of his own ſonnes, and the like, from thoſe pleaſurable things which David affected, but God knew to be naught for him. There was never any arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heretick, or grand impoſtour, but made private ends his cyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſelf-conceit and ſelf-love his card and compaſſe.</p>
               <p>Even after God had wondrouſly appeared unto Moſes, and gave him his miſſion, Moſes replied, Exod. 3.11. <hi>Who am I, that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh? &amp;c.</hi> and Exod. 4.1, 2. his backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe further appeareth: yea, after, though God by his two miracles confirmed the calling, yet twice more did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he was afraid to begin ſo great an alteration, Exod. 4.10. and eſpecially at the 13. verſ. inſomuch that the Lord was angry. Humbleneſſe, which is alwayes accompanied with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, baſhfulneſſe, meaſuring ones own ſtrength, and ſubjection of ſpirit, is to be prayed for, and practiſed by any ſcrupulous Chriſtian, before he make himſelf a formall partie of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or contradiction.</p>
               <p>The third requiſite followeth; That this holy and humbled man conferre with more learned men, and ſpecially with his Paſtour. If his Paſtour give him not ſufficient ſatisfaction, let him conferre with other Divines. Yea, if he be a Paſtour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet let him take heed of ſingularitie, the daughter of pride: and let him not lightly or ſleightly eſteem of their judgements, who more abound in knowledge, or to whom a direction of ſouls is by God himſelf more eſpecially committed; who are, in matters above his capacitie, his proper judges; and he is in ſuch things, to ſubject himſelf unto them. I doubt not, but,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6913:98"/>if his ſuperiours ſhould miſlead him in things ſurmounting his knowledge and capacitie, his humble, conformable obedience, and deſires are better accepted of God, then another man, who without knowledge or any true ground ſtumbleth on a truth, grows talkative and preſumptuous, though he be ready to die for that truth. Above all things, let him not apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch men alone, as he knoweth to be addicted to his own way; nor come with prejudice to heare the contrary part: but ſince he will not reſt in other mens determinations, he, who will be an upright judge, ought indifferently to heare both cauſes pleaded; and, after all good and neceſſary proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure unto true judicature, to judge with right judgement. This is a rock, upon which many ſplit themſelves; who pretend to ſeek out the truth, but go onely to ſuch as they know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand do run with a byas to their humour, and will animate them in their ſingularitie: and thereby, in ſtead of inſtruction, are flattered in their folly, and ſoothed in their erroneous conceits.
<note n="b" place="margin">Qui ſtatuit aliquid parte inauditâ alterâ; Aequum licèt ſtatuerit, haud aequus fuit.</note> 
                  <hi>He that determineth any thing before he hath heard both parties; though he give juſt judgement, he is not a juſt judge.</hi> And again I ſay,
<note n="c" place="margin">Ignorantia in Judice aequipatatur dolo.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignorance in a judge is as bad as injuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this godly man is humbled, when this humble man hath conferred with his own Paſtour, and other learned men and Miniſters, and impartially heard both ſides; and ſtill reſts unſatisfied from others, and his conſcience ſtill ſettled, that he hath the truth; I wiſh him, not blindely to give over himſelf to others; but, keeping the ſtaffe of direction, and the exerciſe of his judgement of diſcretion, (for things within his verge, or reach) and following the wayes of his own conſcience, in the fourth place, I would counſel him to remove into other parts. So Elijah fled from Jezebel; yet poured out his complaints to God, 1. King. 19.3, 10, 14. So our Saviour, when the Jews would have ſtoned him, <hi>hid himſelf,</hi> John 8.59. And he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Apoſtles <hi>to flee from one citie to another,</hi> Matth. 10.23. S. Paul <hi>through a window was let down in a basket by a wall, and eſcaped,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.33. and God himſelf <hi>hid Baruch and Jeremy,</hi> Jer. 36.26. Thus many, both learned and unlearned, did in Queen Maries dayes; and God hath given a great bleſſing oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to this courſe. So S. Cyprian fled at the firſt; and then, during his voluntarie exile, wrote diverſe excelelnt matters, and yet afterwards died a glorious Martyr.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place, if the good Chriſtian will not, or cannot flee, I would now commend unto him ſilence and mourning, as the Prophet Jeremy did; which S. Hierom, Ockam, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Field preſcribe as the onely means. Let him worſhip God in private, as Daniel did <hi>three times a day, and prayed,</hi> Daniel 6.10. for God <hi>will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, &amp;c. This ſhall be written for the generation to come,</hi> as it is Pſal. 102 17, 18. which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:6913:99"/>Pſalme is <hi>a prayer for the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out his complaint before the Lord:</hi> for this is the very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that Pſalme. The Prophets <hi>dayes conſumed like ſmoke, and his bones burnt as an hearth,</hi> verſ. 3. His <hi>heart was ſmitten and withered,</hi> verſ. 4. and <hi>by reaſon of the voice of his groaning, his bones did cleave to his skin,</hi> verſ. 5. He was <hi>a pelican of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and like an owl of the deſert,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>like a ſparrow alone upon the houſe top,</hi> verſ. 7. whiles <hi>his enemies reproached him, and were mad againſt him, and ſworn againſt him, he ate aſhes like bread, and mingled his drink with weeping,</hi> ver. 8, 9. The Lamentations of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy would fit his mouth, and the dolefull complaints in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Pſalmes would well accord with them. But above all, he ſhould call to minde, That there was no ſorrow like Chriſts ſorrow: That he alone trod out the wine-preſſe of Gods wrath: That he was reviled, ſpit upon, buffetted, whipped, crucified; &amp; that deſpiteous piercing rent his very dead body. Let him ſolace his ſoul with ſpirituall comforts, and make melody to God in his heart; loſing himſelf in ſpeculation of Chriſts infinite merit, and applying to his own ſoul all heavenly joy. Let him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from being ſeen in publick: let him embrace pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy and retiredneſſe; living (if it were poſſble) under Jonas his gourd, or in vaults, whoſe darkneſſe and blackneſſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth by internall illumination, and ſpirituall irradiation. The Baptiſt; and our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, betook themſelves to deſerts and mountains for their ſolitary devotions, when errour and unrighteouſneſſe ſat in the chair of Moſes. Thus the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted holy ones of the Primitive Church ſerved God, at the buriall of their dead, <hi>by nightly ſongs,</hi> ſaith

But ſuppoſe he be drawn forth, and cannot lie hid; ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate ſummon him to his tribunall, and examine him very ſtrictly: how then ought this man to behave himſelf? Firſt, I would have him to abhorre all mentall reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If he uſe ambiguity of word, phraſe, or ſentence, (which was the guiſe of the myſterious, enigmaticall oracles) if by an Apoſiopeſis, Irony, or any Rhetoricall figure allowed in art, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed among men, and conceiveable by an intelligent auditour, he excuſe, qualifie, and keep ſecret his own actions or other mens counſels; I will not wholly blame him:

                  <hi>Every one is preſuppoſed to be good, till he is proved to be bad. I am not guilty, ſo farre, as I am bound to accuſe my ſelf.</hi> And this is the allowed generall acceptation of that uſance. Within the veil of ambiguous words there lieth a ſecret, ſecond, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneall good ſenſe; perhaps hid from ſome ſimple ones, yet diſcernable by quick, piercing, and deep apprehenſions; a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6913:99"/>ſenſe couſin-germane in the ſecond degree to the words; a ſenſe involved, implicit, having traces and footſteps of reaſon; hard, yet inveſtigable. <hi>Fuga in perſecutione</hi> is allowed; this <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfugium verborum</hi> is but a branch of it. I will not condemn David for acting the part of a frantick man, to eſcape: <hi>He changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himſelf mad in their hands, and ſcrabled on the doores of the gate, and let his ſpittle fall down upon his beard,</hi> 1. Sam. 21.13. Neither will I wholly diſlike a verball equivocation; while the ſenſe is tranſparent to the wiſe or learned, though veiled to the ignorant. Philip Cominaeus, 4.11. reporteth, that when the Conſtable of France, Earl of S. Paul, had played fouly and falſly on all ſides; King Lewis the eleventh ſaid thus unto Rapine, a truſtie ſervant of the Conſtable, <hi>I am buſied with divers affairs of great importance, and had need of ſuch an head as thy maſters is.</hi> The ſervant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted all comfortably, to the better ſenſe; but the King ſaid ſoftly to the Engliſh men and the Lord of Contay, <hi>I mean not, that we ſhould have the bodie, but the head without the bodie.</hi> This manner of amphibolous ſpeech our Saviour uſed, when he ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy this temple;</hi> which they underſtood of the temple build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtones: <hi>but he ſpake of the temple of his bodie,</hi> John 2.19, 20, 21. And in the eighth of John, Chriſt more then once made uſe of that homonymous verball equivocation.</p>
               <p>But let him flee, as from a ſerpent, ſo from the deluſions of the ſerpent; who of late hath taught his locuſts to make an anſwer conſiſting, part in words expreſſed and intelligible, part of thoughts reſerved and unintelligible: the ſpeakers minde feigning, framing, and new-coyning a wilde ſenſe, which had no correſpondence with the words at all. So that, for example, if the Devil ſhould ask of a Jeſuite, <hi>Wilt thou give me thy ſoul?</hi> the Jeſuite may (by their doctrine) ſafely and ſoundly anſwer him, <hi>I will give thee my ſoul:</hi> provided alwayes, that he keep in the hollow of his heart this mentall reſervation, <hi>If thou be God Almighty.</hi> Thus the Jeſuite thinks, that he can cozen the Devil himſelf, becauſe indeed he is not able to finde out that unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thought of the Jeſuites heart. Yet the Angel of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe perhaps laugheth, perhaps wondereth to ſee himſelf out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in his own wilineſſe and depths, by his own children; though time will declare the truth, that by ſuch ſubtilties they undermine, and blow up, as with gun-powder, their own, and their adherents ſalvations.</p>
               <p>I conclude the point: I will not condemn the man, who handſomely and artfully, without lying or mentall reſervation unconceiveable, can ſhift off danger and trouble from himſelf or his friends; but he condemneth himſelf, who uſeth ſuch dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſſimulation, ſuch <hi>leger du coeur:</hi> who plougheth with an ox and an aſſe; making up a mixt, linſy-woolſy propoſition, of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6913:100"/>words ſenſible and thoughts heterogeneall and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: incomprehenſible (I ſay) by any power or powers created; ſince the thoughts ſtrangely vary from the words, lurking in the vaults of the heart, and can not be fiſhed or hooked out from antecedents, or conſequents, or any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>But, if he be put to his oath, what ſhall he do? If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concern not his life, let him anſwer exactly. Biſhop An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews ſeems to diſlike, <hi>That a man ſhould be ſworn againſt his own life;</hi> becauſe the Prophet, by Gods direction, made that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exception, Jeremy 38.15. and for other reaſons by that moſt Reverend Prelat mentioned, pag. 95. in his <hi>Opuſcula.</hi> Yet my opinion is, <hi>If the life of Kings or Princes, or if the welfare of the Commonwealth be in danger, or any extraordinary miſchief be like to enſue,</hi> (which was not the caſe of Jeremy; a Prophet, no traitour; an holy man, no plotter, contriver, or partaker with wicked ones) <hi>a man may lawfully, by the Magiſtrate, be put to his oath, though it coſt him his life; or to the rack and torture.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall harms muſt have unuſuall remedies. The particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will deſtroy it ſelf, to uphold the univerſall. Rather then there ſhall be a <hi>vacuum,</hi> fire will deſcend.

                  <hi>It is not to be conſidered to whom, but by whom thou haſt ſworn.

Lying, fraud, or any colluſion by mentall reſervation, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball equivocation, is wholly to be ſecluded and abhorred, when an oath is taken: prudent ſilence, in diverſe caſes, is admitted.

                  <hi>It is a juſt and worthy rule, that in every queſtion the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhould be applied to the ſame ſenſe &amp; purpoſe to which the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation is made. To anſwer of one thing when he is asked of another, is the part of a mad man.</hi> Again,
<note n="x" place="margin">Senſus reſponſionis non eſt ad aliud dirigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus quàm ad propoſitum interrogationis: quò ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gìs abſit à Chriſto, quod nè homini quidem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſenſe of the anſwer is not to be directed to any other thing then that which was propounded in the interrogation. So farre is that from Chriſt, which beſeems not a meer man.</hi> So he. I anſwer, firſt, Tertullian ſpeaketh of queſtions in Divinitie, to inſtruct the ſoul: and there it were ſinne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the ſimple queſtioniſt. Secondly, he ſpeaketh of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>extra jactum teli, cùm aries murum non percuſſerit;</hi> of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not concerning great danger, life, or limme: which doth ſomewhat vary the caſe. Thirdly, an homonymous anſwer of verball equivocation, doth both correſpond to the ſenſe of the queſtion, (which is all that Tertullian requireth) and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth alſo a ſecond ſenſe, which may be underſtood by an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hearer; which in a mentall reſervation is impoſſible to be unlocked, opened, and cleared, except by an hand divine. Fourthly, Tertullian cannot be thought to condemn verball equivocation; the daintie uſe whereof makes almoſt as great a difference between a wiſe man and an idiot, as between an idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot and a beaſt; and none but wiſe men can uſe it with comfort and delight. And the wiſer men be, as their hearts, by divers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6913:101"/>thoughts, are deeper then the fools; ſo their words are more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, bivious, multivious. What writings under heaven, of finite men, have or can have ſuch multiplicity of meanings, as are in Scripture compriſed under the words dictated by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Spirit? whoſe whole, intire, exact depths, the meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never knew fully and perfectly. <hi>If I might have my deſire,</hi> quoth S. Auguſtine, <hi>I had rather ſpeak in words, whoſe divers ſenſes might give content to divers people of different apprehenſions, then in words that can have one ſenſe onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I would commend unto this examinate, is, to give faire language to his Judges. Let him not be bold and malapert, nor uſe clamorous oppoſition. Let not the ignorant Syllogize in <hi>Barbara, Darii, Ferio;</hi> or marre his cauſe by ill handling: yet if he be unmoveably conſtant, let him ſay, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſpute, but I can die:</hi> let him not provoke the Judge by words or actions ill adviſed. Eulalia, being a girle about 12 yeares old, did ſpit in the face of the Judge, that he might the rather condemn her. The anſwer of Hannah, 1. Samuel 1.15, &amp;c. when ſhe was in bitterneſſe of ſoul, to the miſjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uncharitably zealous Prieſt Eli, was as a ſweet incenſe in the noſtrils of God; and is a good leſſon for all to take out, when they are called before the Magiſtrates, though hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were offered. <hi>How long wilt thou be drunken,</hi> quoth he? <hi>put away thy wine from thee.</hi> And ſhe anſwered, <hi>No, my lord, I am a woman of a ſorrowfull ſpirit; I have drunk neither wine, nor ſtrong drink, &amp;c. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial.</hi> The manner of anſwering may be ſinfull, though the matter be good: froward behaviour never benefitteth a cauſe, but <hi>a gentle anſwer pacifieth wrath,</hi> Proverbs 15.1. Taunting recrimination argueth a diſtempered ſpirit in the gall of bitterneſſe. How humbly did our bleſſed Saviour behave himſelf under the hands of unjuſt Judges? How conſtantly, zealouſly, and boldly (becauſe they were inſpired immediately from God) did the Apoſtles, Act. 4. plead for themſelves, yet without malapertneſſe, or irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. S. Paul his ſpeech to the high prieſt exacteth a larger diſcourſe. Acts. 23.5, Paul ſaid, <hi>I knew not, brethren, that he was the high prieſt.</hi> Some think, that S. Paul knew Ananias to be high prieſt, when he called him <hi>painted wall.</hi> I anſwer, (if ſo it were) this is no fit example for ſawcineſſe to be uſed, in our times, towards Magiſtrates. For, firſt, if S. Paul did know him, he might ſpeak, though not as a Prophet, yet illuminated and inſpired from God: which now is not in uſe. Secondly, he might ſpeak as a Prophet, foredivining an evil end to Ananias, <hi>as indeed it came to paſſe,</hi> ſaith
<note n="y" place="margin">Homil. 6. de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus Pauli.</note> Chryſoſtom. If any one of them who now revile Magiſtracy, have the ſpirit prophetical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing contingent future things, which yet end in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will not call him a ſawcy preſumptuous fellow. Thirdly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6913:101"/>though divers learned men think the contrary; and that he ſpake by an Irony, when he ſaid, <hi>I knew not:</hi> yet I perſwade my ſelf, that S. Paul, in truth, knew not (when he ſpake) Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias to be the high prieſt, for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he ſeemeth to put on the ſpirit of mildneſſe towards them that ſtood by him, who were alſo the ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſtanders by,</hi> who had ſmit and buffetted him: and calling them by the charitable term of <hi>brethren,</hi> whom it had been fitter to reprove; it argueth his plain ſincerity, ſpeaking of his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if S. Paul had ſpoken by way of jeſt, irriſion, or Irony, when he ſaid, <hi>I knew not, brethren, that he was the high prieſt;</hi> he might well have ceaſed there. But ſince he bringeth in the ſacred Text, ſeriouſly, truly, and ſadly, to confirm his neſciency; and that there is no mocking with the divine veritie; with me it ſhall paſſe currant, that he ſpake from the bottome of his heart, when he ſaid, <hi>he knew him not to be the high prieſt.</hi> The Spirit never taught any inſpired to apply Scripture contrary to their knowledge, nor to cite the ſacred Text of truth to prove an untruth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider the <hi>Antitheſts</hi> and oppoſition between the words. In the fifth verſe he ſaid ſimply, and directly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I knew not:</hi> where his ignorance is the more ſeriouſly profeſſed by the oppoſition in the ſixth verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>But Paul knowing that the one part were Sadduces, and the other Phariſees:</hi> as if the Spirit had ſaid, <hi>Paul indeed was ignorant who was the high prieſt; but he knew they were divided into factions:</hi> the word <hi>But</hi> running with a ſingular emphaſis to this point.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by this expoſition we ſhall cut off that objection, which Julian the Apoſtata uſed againſt S. Paul; as if, by this double dealing, he were a very time-ſerver in his words; we maintaining all to be done in ſolemn gravity, and reality of truth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if S. Paul had ſpoken Ironically, that he had not known the high prieſt, when they knew one an other; how eaſily could the high prieſt have confuted and confounded him, and laid lying and impoſture to his charge? But this he did not do: therefore, in likelihood, S. Paul knew him not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the objections for the former opinion are eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. How could he be ignorant, who was the high prieſt; when he was bred up in their law, and well acquainted and familiarly in their <hi>Synedrion,</hi> and had been there, when S. Stephen was condemned, and when he got letters from the high prieſt, a little before his converſion? eſpecially, ſince he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth to the high prieſt, as to his witneſſe, Acts 22.5?</p>
               <p>To the firſt point; I confeſſe, he was bred up in their law, and could not <hi>then</hi> in likelihood be ignorant who was the high
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6913:102"/>prieſt, or what was his name: yet <hi>now</hi> he might be ignorant; for S. Paul had been away from Jeruſalem a good while, avoiding the ſtorm of perſecution; and high prieſts died as other men: and at that time there were two high prieſts, which was not of old: and with one of them he might not be acquainted.</p>
               <p>Oh, but he frequented the <hi>Synedrion.</hi> I confeſſe, that not onely <hi>the witneſſes laid down their clothes at a young mans feet, whoſe name was Saul,</hi> Acts 7.58. but that <hi>Saul conſented to the death of S. Stephen,</hi> Acts 8.1. and as certain that he (as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall agent) <hi>received letters from the high prieſt, and all the eſtate of the elders,</hi> to ſearch out the Chriſtians, and <hi>to bring them to be puniſhed,</hi> Acts 22.5. and ſo he muſt needs know the high prieſt and the elders, and they him: and therefore, in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he was converſant ſometimes in their <hi>Synedrion.</hi> But I ſay as before, this might not be that high prieſt, who ſat to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn S. Stephen, or to whom S. Paul appealed as witneſſe: but the other high prieſt might ſit at this time, and on this day; ſince now and then one ſat, now and then an other, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both of them. And thus S. Paul might be ignorant, who was his Judge.</p>
               <p>Oh, but he well knew the high prieſt by his place and by his clothes. I anſwer; The Jews were not now ſitting in their Councel-houſe, but where the chief Captain commanded them to appeare, Acts 22.30. himſelf ſitting as the Moderatour in his own tribunall; which he was not wont to do in their <hi>Synedrion:</hi> neither might the high prieſt take the proper veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſuch a place, by which he might be known from others.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up all; If nothing ſaid before do ſatisfie thee, but thou art confident, that S. Paul did know the high prieſt; (though thou wert better to adhere to the words) yet have I found out an other way for the opening of this point, which hath perplexed many learned men. Obſerve therefore, I pray thee, theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that not onely the high prieſt, but all their Councel were ſummoned to appeare, Acts 22.30. and of the Councel each man had liberty to ſpeak at his pleaſure: and at ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick trialls there is a great dinne, murmures, and mutterings; ſo that the ſpeaker is not alwaies diſcernable, whiles many may ſpeak at once, and ſome louder then others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, while <hi>S. Paul earneſtly beheld,</hi> not the high prieſt onely, but <hi>the Councel,</hi> Acts 23.1. (caſting his eyes from one to another) <hi>the high prieſt commanded him to be ſmitten on the mouth.</hi> Theſe words S. Paul might heare: and yet not know, in ſuch a confuſed noiſe, which of thoſe his many Judges ſpake them: and in likelihood thought, that ſuch an unjuſt ſentence could not proceed out of the high prieſts mouth: but to the authour
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6913:102"/>of thoſe words, whoſoever he was, to that unjuſt Judge S. Paul ſharply and punctually replied, <hi>God will judge thee, thou painted wall.</hi> But when S. Paul was informed, that they were the words of the high prieſt himſelf; he was ſory for his quick ſpeech, and ſaid, <hi>I knew not, brethren, that he was the high prieſt.</hi> So that, if S. Paul had known the high prieſt, and the high prieſt him; if they had been well acquainted the one with the other, at this time of S. Pauls triall (which will never be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;) yet here is now a new way, as probable as any, to excuſe the Apoſtle from diſſimulation, and from uſing the Scripture as a cloke to it; <hi>viz.</hi> Though S. Paul knew the man to be the high prieſt; yet he knew not at firſt that it was the high prieſt, who pronounced ſo unjuſt and furious a ſentence: but divers of the ſeventy two Judges might be ſpeaking one to another; and S. Paul might be miſtaken, at firſt, in the ſpeaker: As if he had ſaid, <hi>I knew not, brethren, it was the high prieſt</hi> that ſpake theſe words concerning me.</p>
               <p>And thus, I hope, this difficultie is cleared. I will onely adde this, That divers ancient Fathers from S. Pauls example, in this place, prove his modeſty, moderation, and undiſturbed paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by his ſudden, wiſe, ſetled anſwers: And, That I hold this paraphraſe probable, as if S. Paul had ſaid, <hi>If I had wiſt, that it was the high prieſt who uſed thoſe words; though I would not have forborn others, yet I would have forborn him; ſince God had ſaid,</hi> THOU SHALT NOT SPEAK EVIL OF THE RULER OF THY PEOPLE.</p>
               <p>But yet this man that is ſought out, and drawn into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anſwereth (as he ought to do) truly, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reſervation, modeſtly, and as befitteth him to anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſuperiours: if he receive no ſatisfaction in his conſcience, and his Judges doom him worthy to die; what ſhall he now do? Shall he be over-ruled by his ſuperiours, both ſpirituall and temporall, doing as they do, and thinking as they think? ſhall he go againſt the dictates of his own conſcience? or ſhall he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his bloud and life?</p>
               <p>What my ſelf would do, by Gods grace, I will preſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. Firſt, before I would ſacrifice my life, I would once more recollect my former thoughts for humbleneſſe; and diligently conſider, whether the matters for which I am to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, be abſtruſe depths, beyond my reach or capacity. If they be very intricate, I have cauſe to think, that I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit man to judge of things which I know not, and cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, 2. Cor. 10 13, &amp;c. Secondly, I would in this caſe, before expenſe of bloud, bring my intentions to the touchſtone; call to minde, that good intentions alone cannot excuſe me before God, but good intentions well grounded and regulated. S. Paul with good intentions perſecuted the Church, and was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6913:103"/>injurious: but he <hi>did it ignorantly, in unbelief,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.13. where an ill belief, though meaning well, is counted unbelief. In a good intention S. Peter would have diſſwaded our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from death, but he was called <hi>Satan</hi> for it, Matth. 16.23. though Chriſt had bleſſed him before, and promiſed him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts, verſ. 17, &amp;c. I cannot think, but they who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their children unto Moloch, did think they ſerved God rightly, though indeed they ſerved the Devil: yet God ſaith, Levit. 20.3. <hi>I will ſet my face againſt that man, and will cut him off from among his people.</hi> The prieſts of Baal, who <hi>cut themſelves after their manner with knives, and lancers, till the bloud guſhed out upon them,</hi> 1. King. 18.28. did they not follow the ill guide of a miſled conſcience? did they not think they were in the right? do not millions of Turks, Jews, and of Pagans go to the Devil, though they perſwade themſelves they be in the onely true way? do not many think that to be conſtancie, which in truth is obſtinacie? and that to be knowledge, which is ignorant ſelf-love? There is great reſemblance, and manifold likely hood between ſome truth and ſome errour, and the miſtake is eaſie; and there is a great difference between opinion and ſound belief. Thirdly, I would endeavour to think humbly of my ſelf, and, as the Apoſtle adviſeth, to preferre others before me. I would ruminate on that which the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 13.3. <hi>Though I give my bodie to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And, ſhewing what he meaneth by <hi>charity,</hi> addeth, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſuffereth long, and is kinde: charity envieth not: charity is not raſh,</hi> or, <hi>vaunteth not it ſelf: is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly.</hi> So that he who behaveth himſelf unſeemly, who is puffed up, who vaunteth himſelf, or is raſh, who envieth, and is unkinde, and haſty, hath not charity: And, <hi>though he give his bodie to be burned, his death profiteth him nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Examine therefore, and again I ſay, examine thine own heart: if thou finde any one of theſe ſinnes beforenamed reigning in thee, then know there is a ſpot in the ſacrifice. And till that be waſhed away, raſed out, or reformed; thou muſt ſuſpect thy ſelf, and mayeſt well be dubious. Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is a branch of pride: pride never agreed with charity: and no death profiteth a man any thing, who hath not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Oh, but this enfeebleth the reſolution of confeſſours, and ſtoopeth down the conſtancy of martyrs to pendulousneſſe: it maketh them draw their hands back from the plough, and to look backward to Sodom, with lots wife. No no, my diſcourſe intends onely to dull the edge of ſingularity, to ſtop the mouths of pridie undertakers, and ignorant praters, to put a bridle into the teeth of ſuch as revile Magiſtracie, to reduce people to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, and ſuch thoughts as theſe, <hi>If many may be deceived;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6913:103"/>how much eaſier may I? If the more learned be awrie; how ſhall I be ſure I am right? They have ſouls to anſwer, as well as I: and charity bids me think, they would not damn their own ſouls by damning mine: have I alone a ſound rectified conſcience?</hi> Self-deniall is a better ſchoolmaſter to true knowledge, then preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. An acceptable martyr is a reaſonable ſacrifice, and an acceptable ſacrifice is a reaſonable martyr. A conſcience not founded on good cauſes, not ſtrengthened with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is like a fair houſe built on the ſands, a very apple of Sodom, <hi>a painted ſepulchre, which appeares beautifull outward, but is within full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanneſſe,</hi> Matth. 23.27. My cautions are not remoraes, of ſtaying or withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any man, ſo farre as his knowledge can or doth aſpire unto; (for ſo farre I allow them a judgement of diſcretion) but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparatives to the true, perfect, and glorious martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He ſhall be no martyr in my eſtimate, who without great motives runneth to death, and poſteth raſhly to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But when pride with all her children, ſingularity, ſelf-love, vaunting, raſhneſſe, unſeemly behaviour, is caſt out of the ſoul; and the contrary graces, the children of charitie, poſſeſſe it: then, if thy conſcience can no way be convicted; if thou knoweſt thy cauſe to be good, and the contrary to be apparently amiſſe; follow not the multitude, conform not thy ſelf to the world, keep thy conſcience untainted, poure out thy bloud unto death, offer thy life and body as a reaſonable ſacrifice; die, and be a martyr; be a martyr, and be crowned; crowned, I ſay, not onely with glory and immortality, but with thoſe gifts and <hi>aureolae,</hi> which are prepared above others for true mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. In this ſort, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe Chriſt before men, him will Chriſt confeſſe alſo before his Father which is in heaven;</hi> Matth. 10.32.</p>
               <p>The judgement of juriſdiction, which is in ſuperiours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving authoritie; and the judgement of direction, which is in Paſtours by way of eminency, forbid not in this caſe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion, which is and ought to be in every private man, ſo farre as he hath diſcretion and knowledge or immediate inſpirations: of all which I would not have a man too preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous.</p>
               <p>That which our Divines do term <hi>the judgement of diſcretion,</hi> is, in the words of
<note n="z" place="margin">Contra Marcionem 4. poſt medium pag. 269.</note> Tertullian, <hi>Clavis Agnitionis:</hi> He muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contrary this; for this muſt he die. What he knoweth, let him, as a good witneſſe, ſeal with his bloud, if need be. But in things beyond a ſimple mans capacitie, I will ſay once more, with
<note n="a" place="margin">Serm. 20. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Apoſtoli.</note> Auguſtine,
<note n="b" place="margin">Melior eſt fidelis ignorantia quàm teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria ſcientia.</note> 
                  <hi>A faithfull ignorance is better then a raſh knowledge.</hi> In ſuch things is he to be guided by his Paſtours. The eaſie things any man may judge of: in the more abſtruſe, the voice of the Paſtours is to be followed.
<note n="c" place="margin">Quam clavem habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant Legis Dectores, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi interpretationem le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis?</note> 
                  <hi>What key had the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6913:104"/>Doctours of the law,</hi> (ſaith Tertullian in the ſame place) <hi>but the interpretation of the law?</hi> So <hi>the key of interpretation</hi> reſts in the miniſtery, for things which need interpretation, as hard places do; though <hi>the key of agnition,</hi> in things unto which their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can aſpire, is permitted, yea, commended unto all men: and they who withhold this <hi>key of knowledge</hi> from the people, are accurſed by Chriſt, Luke 11.52.</p>
               <p>To the further explaining of my opinion, let us conſider, in a Church corrupted, theſe two ſorts of people. Firſt, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, either Civil or Eccleſiaſticall: And we will ſubdivide them into the Wilfully blinde, and the Purblinde.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt were ſome Biſhops, and Nobles, and Gentry in Queen Maries dayes; who hunted after bloud, even the bloud of innocents; and ſtrained their authority to the higheſt. Such is now the Inquiſition, falſly called <hi>the holy houſe,</hi> with all the chief officers thereof: ſuch in the dayes of Chriſt, were divers Scribes, Phariſees, Sadduces, and ſome Rulers of the people; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth to be on Chriſts ſide, by his doing ſuch miracles as no man ever did before, did choke and ſtrangle their belief, made ſhipwrack of their conſciences, reſiſted the holy Spirit; who would <hi>neither go into the kingdome of heaven, nor ſuffer others that</hi> were <hi>entering, to go in:</hi> againſt whom Chriſt pronounced <hi>wo</hi> upon <hi>wo,</hi> Matth. 23.13. &amp;c. For <hi>they took away the key of knowledge,</hi> Luke 11.52. and purpoſely kept the people igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and blinde. According to their demerits, there are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for them <hi>intima inferni, the depths of hell,</hi> blackneſſe of darkneſſe, and the greateſt torments thereof, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>The next tribe, or ſort, are the purblinde Magiſtracy, either Secular, or Clergy. Such were divers in the dayes of Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; who had learning enough, to know that all went not right; yet did not vehemently oppoſe the truth, but did ſwimme with the ſtream, &amp; made the time their ſtern; the whole Church turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and returning three or foure times in one age. Theſe were ſeduced, as well as ſeducers. Such alſo at this day are divers in the Papacy; more moderate, leſſe rigid and rigorous, concealing ſome truths they know, becauſe they have given up their hearts and beliefs to truſt in their Church, for ſuch things as they do not know; though they have means to learn, and capacitie to underſtand, if they would; and therefore are faulty. Such alſo were divers in the Jewiſh Church and State. <hi>Ye killed the Prince of life,</hi> ſaith S. Peter to the people, Acts 3.15. <hi>And now brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did alſo your rulers.</hi> Such were thoſe Phariſees, Matth. 15.12. who <hi>were offended</hi> with Chriſt; of whom Chriſt ſaith, verſ. 14. <hi>They be blinde leaders of the blinde. And if the blinde lead the blinde, both ſhall fall into the ditch:
<note n="d" place="margin">In foveam peecati &amp; inferni.</note> Into the ditch of ſinne and hell,</hi> ſaith Hugo Cardinalis, on
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6913:104"/>the place.
<note n="e" place="margin">Cùm paſtor per ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupta graditur, neceſſe eſt ut grex in praecipiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ducatur.</note> 
                  <hi>When the ſhepherd goes by craggie clifts, the flock muſt needs fall headlong and break their necks,</hi> ſaith Gregory.
<note n="f" place="margin">Duces, praeceptores; fovea, infernus.</note> 
                  <hi>The guides are the teachers, and the ditch is hell,</hi> ſaith Faber Stapulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, on the place. So much of the purblinde Magiſtracy, Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Laicall, in a corrupted Church.</p>
               <p>From the Magiſtrates in the firſt place, we deſcend to the people in the ſecond place, whom we alſo divide into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ranks and files.</p>
               <p>In the generall, they are either learned or unlearned. The learned are firſt ſuch, as go againſt their conſcience, and practiſe contrary to their knowledge and belief, ſailing with winde and tide: and becauſe they will be found fault withall by the feweſt, they will do as the moſt do. Timorous hypocrites they are; fearing perſecution, loſſe of goods, liberty, and life, more then they fear God, who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul: for whom is kept the allotment of hypocrites; brimſtone and fire, ſtorm and tempeſt, <hi>ignis &amp; vermis:</hi> this ſhall be their portion to drink, without repentance.</p>
               <p>An other ſort of learned men profeſſing truth, there are in a corrupted Church; and each of them (forſooth) will be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of the publick: theſe <hi>deſpiſe government, are preſumptuous, ſelf-willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> 2. Pet. 2.10. <hi>ſpeaking evil of the things that they underſtand not,</hi> verſ. 12. (as out of queſtion they underſtand not all things, which in their carping humour they cenſure:) people-pleaſers, ambitious of eſteem, full of words, running as much after their own will as after their conſciences, hearty enough to draw on danger, obſtinate enough to provoke death. Of theſe men, though they die for ſome truths; yet becauſe they have a mixture of many errours in their intellect, perverſeneſſe in their will, and ill grounded, ill bounded affections, wanting thoſe godly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of charity before ſpoken of; we may pronounce, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>They ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption,</hi> 2. Pet. 2.12. Such a fellow was he, and his like, of whom
<note n="g" place="margin">Anno 1543.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fox reporteth, that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the words to this effect, <hi>The word of God is to be broken, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and eaten.</hi> So when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my bloud:</hi> the bleſſed words are miſſenſed; as if Chriſt had then ſaid, <hi>The Scripture muſt be given to the people, and received by them.</hi> By which forced expoſition, the ſeal of our redemption is troden under foot, the thrice-bleſſed ſacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Lord is utterly annihilated; whereas indeed, in the words of conſecration, there are included <hi>verba concionatoria &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicanda, words predicatorie and ſerving for doctrine.</hi> I will not eſteem him as an holy perfect martyr, who dieth with ſuch crotchets in his brain, ſuch pride in his heart. Such an one was Ravaillac, who for conſcience ſake (forſooth) ſtabbed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:6913:105"/>of the Lord, the Heros of our time, his naturall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, Henry the fourth of France. He followed his conſcience; but his conſcience had ill guides. When he had outfaced tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and death it ſelf (though he thought that he died a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr) if he died unrepentant, the powers of hell gat hold upon him.</p>
               <p>Such manner of people were thoſe Jews, who in moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate faſhion ſaid, <hi>His bloud be on us, and on our children,</hi> Matt. 27.25. Do you think they all were wholly ignorant? do you think, they all ſwerved againſt their conſciences? or rather, medled they not in things above their callings? were they not too preſumptuous? Thus, though they had the knowledge of ſome truths, and perhaps would have died for them; yet their zeal wanted more and better knowledge, to have recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their conſciences: and they ſhould have called to minde the miracles of Chriſt, and born witneſſe to his innocency, rather then to ſet themſelves forward in things beyond their reach and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Philip de

Which intendments of theirs ſeem rather to be the fruits of evil then of Chriſtian fortitude. For,
<note n="i" place="margin">Mater martyri eſt fides Catholica, in qua illuſtres Athletae ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine ſuo ſubſcripſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</note> 
                  <hi>The mother of martyrdome is the Catholick faith, to which thoſe famous champions have ſubſcribed with their bloud,</hi> ſaith Aquin, out of Maximus. But thoſe bravadoes of the Friers ſavoured of the tranſalpine and ciſalpine factions: ſome inclining to the French king, with his adherents, the other to the Pope and Venetians, and their partakers.</p>
               <p>Some drew death upon them, when they needed not, in the Primitive Church; and the holy Fathers, and Councels, have diſliked them for it. The Elibertine Councel, chap. 60.
<note n="k" place="margin">Si quis idola fregerit, &amp; ibidem fuerit occiſus; quia in Evangelio non eſt ſcriptum, neque in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venitur ab Apoſtolis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam factum, placuit in uumerum eum non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi martyrum.</note> 
                  <hi>If any one break idols, and be killed in the act, we think it not fit that he be received into the number of martyrs, becauſe for his ſo doing he had neither warrant of Scripture, nor example of the Apoſtles.</hi> The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcellions thruſt themſelves into the mouth of dangers: ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of martyrdome to that height of infatuation, that if no body would kill them, they would murder and maſſacre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>There were alſo certain women, who to keep their chaſtity haſtened their own deaths. <hi>Sophconia killed her ſelf, leſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Maximinus ſhould abuſe her,</hi> ſaith Euſebius. Pelagia flung her ſelf headlong into a river, leſt a ſouldier ſhould violate her. Such things ought not to be done, and are ſinfull, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be done. And yet becauſe the Church hath accounted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6913:105"/>them martyrs, we muſt conclude that the Church did think, they had divine inſpirations directly animating them to that courſe, as Samſon had in the Old Teſtament.

               </p>
               <p>The third and laſt ſort of learned men, in a Church and State full of errours, are thus qualified;</p>
               <p>They are pious towards God, charitable towards men, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, according to their knowledge, knowing ſo much as they can well learn, mourners for ſick and dead in Sion, ſigning their cheeks with teares for the backſliding of the people, having <hi>cornea genua,</hi> knees hardned like horn by their frequent bendings at prayers, that God would ſhew mercy to the miſguided; ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in their hearts when danger ſtoppeth their mouths; not petulant, or immodeſt againſt the Magiſtrates; no prompt, proterve undertakers; no railers, cenſurers, or raſh damners of others; no factioniſts, or diſturbers of Commonweals; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtorms of perſecution, ſo farre as conveniently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably they may; <hi>keeping the unity of truth,</hi> as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>in the bond of peace;</hi> thus farre flexible and pliable, that they would willingly exchange any old errour (if ſuch be ſetled in them) for apparent truth; thus farre conſtant and irremoveable, that they preferre the naked truth above their lives, and can in all humbleneſſe and patience write the confeſſion of their faith with their own bloud. Such a life may I live, ſuch a death may I die: greater glory then ſuch ſhall have, I deſire not. This is the true character of a martyr, ſo perfect as uſually fleſh and bloud affords.</p>
               <p>The laſt point concerneth unlearned men, who live in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Church. Shall theſe be ruled by their Paſtours, leaving the dictates of their own conſciences, unpractiſed, unbeleeved? I anſwer, There is not the ſimpleſt of the people, to whom I will denie a judgement of diſcretion: which he is bound to follow, even unto death, according to his conſcience. And among the unlearned, there are ſome of excellent wits, quick capacities, and ſome endowments, both of nature and grace, ſurpaſſing divers learned men. Yet let every one of theſe take this advice from me; let them learn to be <hi>Chriſti-formes, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Chriſt,</hi> (which is a point that the godly and learned Cardinall Cuſanus often and excellently inculcateth) and let
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6913:106"/>them labour to be every way equall to that famous martyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom immediatly before I characterized and deſcribed. By how much the leſſe they have of knowledge, let them have the more of humilitie and conformableneſſe. Laſtly, let them ponder, how mercifull the Lord is to ſuch as ſinne of ignorance: and on the contrarie, that not onely divers of the unlearned, but ſuch as have had a fair competency of knowledge, have been tranſported with ſelf-love; and treading out paths of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, have runne headlong into damnation. Witneſſe divers Arians, burnt in the dayes of Queen Eliſabeth: witneſſe Hacket, ſeduced by the Devil under a ſhew of long, extemporary prayers, and extraordinary holineſſe; till at the end he grew blaſphemous, and in the heat of it died. Let him think of Sir John Oldcaſtle; who intimated, not onely a poſſibility, but a likelihood of his <hi>riſing again the third day after his hanging and burning,</hi> if Stows chronicles had ſufficient ground to write to that effect. If I ſhould repeat the like monſters in other Churches and Commonwealths, I might much more enlarge this diſcourſe, which is too long already. I conclude: The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unlearned good man, who is bound up in invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and is miſled by his Paſtours, to whoſe guidance he hath ſubjected his conſcience, is leſſe ſinfull, by many degrees, then he who caſteth himſelf violently, ſingularly, and proudly, into the ſame errours, or as bad. And if it be dangerous to take from the people their diſcerning power, in any cauſe, as ſome imagine; let them ponder, whether it be not more dangerous, to let every one of them to runne looſe, like the unbridled Circumcellions, to chooſe their own wayes, (which is the guiſe of Separatiſts) and to be their own judges, and judges of whatſoever their Paſtours preach, (which is the practice of ill taught zelots in our Church) and by neceſſary conſequence, judges of things of Faith, of Controverſies, and of Scripture it ſelf: And ſo the ſupreameſt Tribunall, for interpretation of matters religious, to be the conſcience of an unlearned brain. But thou, O Man of God, flee theſe extreams; and, O bleſſed God and man, O Saviour of mankinde, Jeſu Chriſt, keep us in the mean, and bring us by holineſſe to the truth, and by thy truth unto thy glory. So be it, Lord Jeſu, ſo be it.</p>

For be ye not deceived, O over-inſpired brethren; neither Moſes, nor the Prophets, nor Chriſt, nor the Evangeliſts or Apoſtles ever wrote or penned your Engliſh Scripture. They wrote in Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack, and Greek: but they were your Paſtours, who tranſlated the word of God into our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue; and ſome tranſlations are more imperfect then other, and no one abſolutely perfect. And will you, ſilly igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, who cannot know whether the words be true or falſe, well or ill tranſlated, be every one of you your judges of the meaning thereof, (which in deep points is harder then tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) and uſurp the power of interpretation? I may take up the complaint of Michael Piccart, in his epigram before Balthaſar Bambach his tractates,
<q>

               </p>
               <p>Yea, I have an intent to have a bout with the learned Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Heinſius, for maintaining in the preface to his <hi>Ariſtarchus Sacer</hi> upon Nonnus, <hi>That no man can rightly interpret the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but he that is skilled in Eaſtern languages; Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack, and Greek both ſacred and profane, Helleniſtical and the pure,</hi> which is all one in effect with the Jewiſh-Greek, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-Greek. Some of his words, pag. 53. are theſe,
<note n="r" place="margin">Multum reſert ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Hebraea Helleniſtes Graecè expreſſerit, an Syra: Hebraeum item textum, an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones reſpiciat Graeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. Quae niſi omnia diſtinguat, operam neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe eſt interpres ludat. Nos autem, ut exiguae ſcientiae, it à nullius, ut loquuntur vulgò, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae exiſtimamus, qui tranſferre Sacra audet, nec de iſtis cogitavit.</note> 
                  <hi>It is very materiall to know, whether it be Hebrew or Syriack which the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt expreſſeth in Greek: alſo, whether he hath reſpect to the Hebrew Text, or to the Greek tranſlations of it. All which unleſſe the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitour diſtinctly conſidereth, he muſt needs loſe his labour. And we think him to be a man as of little skill, ſo of no conſcience, that dares tranſlate the Scriptures without any conſideration of theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both theſe were eminent profeſſours, and men ſingular among thouſands; the firſt in High-Germany, the other in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; from whence ſome of them brag, and ſome of us rejoyce that we have received the reformation of religion. I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbly propound to your religious conſiderations theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the difficulties of the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Aramean languages in the Old Teſtament, and of the Greek
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6913:107"/>in the New, eſpecially where it reflecteth up to the Syriack, are above common capacities, even of the learned. I might adde, that words of divers other languages are part of the ſacred Text. The Egyptian <hi>Abrech,</hi> Geneſ. 41.43. the Arabick <hi>Lehhem,</hi> Job 6.7. and <hi>Totaphoth,</hi> Exod. 13.16. a compound of Egyptian and African languages, and the like. Yea one verſe, and one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was written by Jeremy in the Chaldee language, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeremy 10.11. which every captive Jew was commanded to caſt in the teeth of the Babylonians. Moreover Daniel 5.25. <hi>Mene Mene, Tekel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pharſin,</hi> was written in the Chaldee, with the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan letters: ſo that the Chaldeans themſelves could not reade their own language. I would tell you of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> finall being placed in the middle of a word of the Text, and of divers other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which in part I paſſe over, and in part thus contract, in the obſervations following.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Hebrew words without points may have foure or five ſignifications, according to the diverſity of vowels affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and have no certain meaning, but as it is guided by antecedents and conſequents. And yet you ſhall have an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant mechanick, or talkative woman, as confident of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vean Tranſlation and notes, as if God himſelf did ſpeak or write the ſame words, as he did once the law on Horeb.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that in the Hebrew many words are written with fewer letters, then they are pronounced.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that many are written with more letters, then they are pronounced.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that divers words are written in the ſacred Text, which are not pronounced at all, but others are read in their ſtead.

                  <hi>There are eight words written in the Text, but not read, which the Maſora alledgeth,</hi> Ruth 3.12.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that the Jews have moſt ſeverely and ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, that any Rabbin ſhould teach Chriſtians the true ſenſe of the Talmuds; which (as they boaſt) no labour and endeavour can attain unto without ſuch a guide. Elias Levita in Maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oreth-Hammaſſoreth, complaineth, that the Jews were wonderfully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him, becauſe he inſtructed Chriſtians in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew. And though ſome tax him for ſinging <hi>placentia,</hi> to ſooth &amp; flatter his patron Aegidius; and call him a turn-coat, becauſe he came forth of the Jewiſh ſynagogue to pray with us in our temples: yet that odious name ought to have been ſpared, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he kept ſtill a Jewiſh heart within him; which certainly he did, if Balthaſar Bambach ſaith truly of him,
<note n="t" place="margin">Praecipua myſteria reticuit, &amp; nibil arcani revelavit.</note> 
                  <hi>He concealed the chief myſteries, and revealed nothing of their ſecrets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, that many Hebrew Radixes do ſignifie not onely things wonderfully diſparat, and incompatible the one with the other (as <hi>Sheol</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>grave</hi> in ſome places, and <hi>hell</hi> in other places: which cauſed ſome to deny Chriſts deſcent in his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6913:107"/>humane ſoul into hell) but even things clean contrary. This inſtance (as the former) ſhall be in a word generally known. Job 2.9. his wife ſaith unto him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Curſe God;</hi> others render it, <hi>Bleſſe God.</hi> None hitherto hath infallibly expounded it. Yet my Laick can <hi>ſwallow camels, &amp; ſtrain at gnats,</hi> that is, buildeth upon the Tranſlation made by the Miniſters, though the ground hath been ſlippery and full of ice; but will (forſooth) be judge of the meaning, when he underſtandeth not the words: as if one unskilfull in the Dutch language ſhould ſay, when he heard a German ſpeak, <hi>I know his meaning by his gaping, or by the ſound of his words, or by the gargariſm of his throat-ſpeech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Theſſal. 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good;</hi> yet he ſpeaketh of the ſpirits of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, or miſperſwaſions of the falſe Apoſtles; who preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very much, and knew very little. Theſe are to be tried. But concerning the decrees of the Church, the ſame Apoſtle doth not ſay, Prove them, examine them, trie them, judge them: but Acts 16.4, Paul and other Miniſters, <hi>as they went through the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, delivered them the decrees for to keep,</hi> (or obſerve) <hi>that were ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders which were at Jeruſalem. And ſo</hi> (or by this means of keeping, or obſervation) <hi>were the Churches eſtabliſhed in the faith, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 5. But (ſaith the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Libertine) I am a man ſpirituall: <hi>But he that is ſpirituall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man,</hi> 1. Corinth. 2.15. I anſwer, S. Paul ſpeaketh of the Apoſtles, who had the Spirit of God, verſ. 12. and ſpake in words which the holy Ghoſt taught, verſ. 13. and who might well neglect the judgement of men, 1. Corinth. 3.3. Prove thou thy Apoſtleſhip by ſuch undeniable miracles and teſtimonies, as they did; and thou ſhalt judge, and not be judged. But that every idiot ſhould claim the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Apoſtle, is lewd divinity, or rather inſufferable pride. The Angel in the Church of Thyatira is cenſured, Revel. 2.20. <hi>becauſe he ſuffered that woman Jezebel, which called her ſelf a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſe, to teach and ſeduce Gods ſervants.</hi> If the profoundeſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines on earth, unexperienced in worldly courſes, ſhould teach the skilfulleſt tradeſmen their trades, or manufactures, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in their crafts (as they call them;) would they not expoſe themſelves to laughter and mocking? is not the proverb of the world too true, <hi>The greateſt Clerks are not the wiſeſt men, if you take them from their books?</hi> Are there more depths in trades, then in the Word of God? Or ſhall tradeſmen, and women judge of the depths of Divinity; and the learned Divines in their own profeſſion be not beleeved, but laught at, controlled, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the private ſpirit of unlearned people? Are not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prophets ſubject to the Prophets? Very learned men ſcarce truſt to themſelves. A Phyſician that is very ſick, ſeeks counſel of an other who is whole, and dares not truſt his own
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6913:108"/>judgement: and ſhall a ſoul ſick of ſinne, ſick of errour, ſick of ſcruples, be its own helper? ſhall it underſtand without a guide? be cleanſed of its leproſie without a Prieſt? Hierome in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary upon the epiſtle to the Eph. thus, <hi>From my youth I never ceaſed to reade, or to ask of learned men what I knew not. I never was mine own Maſter, or taught my ſelf: and of late I journeyed purpoſely to Alexandria, unto Didymus, that he might ſatisfie me in all the doubts which I had found in the Scripture.</hi> Now adayes many a one is wiſer then his Teachers; not by ſupernall illumination, but by infernall preſumption. And if they have gotten by rote the letter of Scripture, and can readily cite <hi>tmemata &amp; tmema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> the chapter and the verſe, (though they have little more judgement then Cardinall Aſcanius his parret, which would prate the Creed all over) they vilifie the opinions of the moſt learned, and their private ſpirit of ſeduction will beare them out.

How often doth he confeſſe his own ignorance, though he was the moſt acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that ever writ ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles? It was a wiſe obſervation of Scaliger, <hi>That ſome words and paſſages in Plato
<note n="y" place="margin">Plus ſapiunt authore.</note> are wiſer then their authour:</hi> and many excellent conceits are collected from Homer and Ariſtotle, which they never dreamed of. But in the Word of God it is contrary. The Spirit was, and is infinite that did dictate it: the finite capacity of man cannot comprehend it: whatſoever good interpretation we finde, may well be thought to be the meaning of the Spirit: and yet the Spirit may, and doth mean many things, which the wit of any man could never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe. And the true literal ſenſe is the hardeſt to finde.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe I have dwelt too long on this point; but it is to vindicate the authority of our Church from the ſingular fancies of private unskilfull, unlearned, and cenſorious men and women, and to ſhew the madnes of thoſe baſe people-pleaſers or <hi>publico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae,</hi> who make, or eſteem tradeſmen, and youth, and ill-nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unlettered idiots (yea though their places be eminent) the competent judges of controverſies; whileſt they flee from the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6913:108"/>chairs of the Univerſities, and from the repreſentative Church of our kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt learned Biſhops, and Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-houſe; unto whom they ought to have recourſe, and in whoſe judgement they are, by way of obedience, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſet up their reſt. For as for private immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and infallible revelation, there is none at all; or, if any be, it is in ſome of thoſe learned ones, who are lawfully called to be the members of our Church repreſentative. And if any defects be in learned men, there are more in unlearned. But of this point otherwhere.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Another obſervation there is, <hi>That kings and ſupream Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do repreſent the people committed to their charge.</hi> And here I will tell you, in honour of the Royall Majeſty, what

               <p>that is, <hi>Apollo being incenſed againſt the King Agamemnon, ſent an evil diſeaſe upon his army; and the people periſhed.</hi> The ſtory is memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, of Saul, 1. Sam. 14.24, &amp;c. He took a fooliſh and raſh oath, hurtfull to his own ſouldiers, profitable for the enemy. Neither Jonathan, nor the Captains, nor the people did ſwear with him, but in him, and by him, and through his oath: yet it bound both the people and himſelf; yea tied aſwell Jonathan,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:6913:109"/>who heard it not, and knew it not, as thoſe who were preſent, and heard it: for the lot from God drew Jonathan out, as faulty, and puniſhable for his fathers adjuration; who ſware expreſly, by name, the death of Jonathan (if he were faulty) verſ. 39. yet the love of the people delivered him; and (as I think) the father did not much care to break his oath. In this fact Sauls perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the whole army; and the people, for their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, held themſelves wrapped up to obedience in his oath.</p>
               <p>But what do I inſtance in ſlighter matters, when a proof is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant, <hi>That the chief governours oaths binde the whole nation &amp; their poſterity for evermore, while their Polity laſted?</hi> Joſhua unadviſedly, without counſelling with God, <hi>made peace and league with the Gibeonites,</hi> (the deſcendants of Canaan, that <hi>ſervant of ſervants) to let them live</hi> in the loweſt rank of ſlaves: <hi>and the Princes of the congregation ſware unto them,</hi> Joſh. 9.15. And though <hi>all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation murmured againſt the Princes,</hi> verſ. 18. (from whence I conclude, that the people conſented not to the treaty, much leſſe were ſworn to it) yet the Princes reſolved juſtly and conſcionably, <hi>We have ſworn unto them by the Lord God of Iſrael: now therefore we may not touch them,</hi> verſ. 19. And verſ. 20. thus, <hi>We will even let them live, leſt wrath be upon us, becauſe of the oath which we ſware unto them.</hi> And accordingly Joſhua freed them from the intended ſlaughter of the angry Iſraelites, verſ. 26. That this oath concerned not the people then living onely, but reached alſo unto poſterity, is apparent, 2. Sam. 21.1, &amp;c. When for the breach of this oath, committed about foure hundred yeares after, the Lord himſelf taxeth <hi>Saul and his bloudy houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites;</hi> and therefore ſent purpoſely a trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall famine upon the land; and Gods wrath was not ſatisfied, till the Gibeonites were appeaſed by the death of Sauls poſterity. And theſe 5 things are yet obſervable. Firſt, Saul ſought to ſlay the Gibeonites, <hi>in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> v. 2. Secondly, <hi>God commanded Moſes to deſtroy all the inhabitants of the land,</hi> whereof the Gibeonites were part, as they themſelves confeſſed, Joſh. 9.24. Thirdly, what was the oath of the Princes onely, is ſaid to be the oath of the children of Iſrael, (as it is, 2. Sam. 21.2.) becauſe it concerned them for ever. Fourthly, after the puniſhment, for this cauſe inflicted, <hi>God was intreated for the land.</hi> Fifthly, it was about foure hundred yeares after the oath of Joſhua and the Princes, when God thus ſeverely vindicated the breach thereof by Saul, upon Sauls poſterity.</p>

From which poſitive proofs, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that Chriſt ſtood in our ſtead, and that almoſt all (if not all) his actions and paſſions, as he was the Mediatour between God and man, were repreſentative of us, let us deſcend to the comparative, and ſhew, that Chriſt hath done, and will do more good unto us, then Adam hath done harm. Which point I have more enlarged in my Sermon (at the re-admitting into our Church, of a penitent Chriſtian from Turciſme) being one of the two, intituled, <hi>A return from Argier:</hi> where theſe five reaſons are enlarged. Firſt, that Adam conveyed to us onely one ſinne: but Chriſt giveth diverſities of grace, and many vertues, which Adam and his poſterity ſhould never have had; as patience, virginity, repentance, compaſſion, fraternall correction, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. Secondly, Adams ſinne was the ſinne of a meer man onely: but the Sonne of God merited for us. Thirdly, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams offence we are likened to beaſts; by the grace of Chriſt our nature is exalted above all Angels. Fourthly, Adams diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience could not infect Chriſt: Chriſts merit cleanſed Adam, ſaving his ſoul and body. Fifthly, as by the firſt Adam goodnes was deſtroyed; ſo by the ſecond Adam greater goodnes is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and all puniſhments, yea all our own ſinnes turned to our further good.</p>
               <p>To which I will annex theſe things following. By Adams ſinne we were eaſily ſeparated from God: Satan, the woman, and an apple were the onely means: But <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6913:110"/>the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.38.) <hi>that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God.</hi> Again, Rom. 5.13, &amp;c. the Apoſtle ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to divide the whole of time in this world, into three parts, under three laws; the law of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Moſes, of Chriſt. In the firſt ſection of time, ſinne was in the world:—<hi>Nevertheleſſe, death reigned from Adam to Moſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. In the law of Moſes, though death was in the world, yet ſinne chiefly reigned, and the rather for the law:
<q>Nitimur in vetitum ſemper, cupimúſque negatum:</q> This the Apoſtle confirmeth often, eſpecially Rom. 7.8. <hi>Sinne taking occaſion, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> The third part of times diviſion is in the dayes of grace, under Chriſt: and now, not ſo much death, not ſo much ſinne, as righteouſnes and life do reigne, or rather we in them, by Chriſt; and the power of both the other is diminiſhed, and ſhall be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed.</p>
               <p>If Adam hurt all mankinde one way or other, Chriſt hath helped all mankinde many wayes. In this life he giveth many bleſſings unto the reprobate: his ſunne ſhineth on all, his rain falleth both upon good and bad: and I do not think, that there ever was the man, at leaſt within the verge of the Church, but had at ſome time or other ſuch a portion of Gods favour, and ſuch ſweet inſpirations put into his heart, that, if he had not quenched by his naturall frowardnes the holy motions of the Spirit, God would have added more grace, even enough to have brought him to ſalvation. For <hi>God is rich in mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2.4. <hi>The Father of mercies,</hi> 2. Corinth. 1.3. <hi>Thou loveſt all things that are, and abhorreſt nothing that thou haſt made: for never wouldeſt thou have made any thing, if thou hadſt hated it,</hi> Wiſd. 11.24. <hi>What thou doſt abhorre or hate, thou doſt wiſh not to be; what thou doſt make, thou doſt deſire it ſhould be,</hi> ſaith Holcot on the place. In our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-book, toward the end of the Commination, this is the acknowledgement of our Church, <hi>O mercifull God, which haſt compaſsion of all men, and hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, which wouldeſt not the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould rather turn from ſinne, and be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> God is intituled <gap reason="foreign">

But I return to their anſwer, That reſpect was had to the primitive dayes of Chriſts Church; and, That we are to conſider, that when Chriſt likened <hi>the Kingdome of God to a grain of muſtard ſeed, which waxed a great tree; and to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which leavened the whole</hi> lump, Luke 13.18, &amp;c. he ſpake not without reference to his own dayes, in which they were generally perſwaded, (as the Papiſts are now) that many were eaſily ſaved in their Church: whereupon one wondering at Chriſts doctrine, of the hardly obtaining of heaven, and that by few, ſaith (Luke 13.23.) <hi>Lord, are there few that be ſaved?</hi> And Chriſt anſwereth, not without reſpect to thoſe times, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: for many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able:</hi> becauſe they ſought awry, and refuſed the right way offered.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6913:111"/>Jews, waning and decreaſing. Yea, at this preſent, though a diligent computer ſhall not finde much fault with me, for ſaying, that, if the world were divided, for places and people, into thirty parts, Nineteen thereof are Infidels, ſix of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometane Religion, and five of the Chriſtian, the Romane Church and the Reformed Churches making but one part of the five; (ſo that the Greek Churches may more brag of their Catholiciſme, then the Romane; and the ſcabbed petite flock, and ſchiſmaticall parlour-full, yea ſcarce hand-full of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts of Amſterdam, may ceaſe to claim themſelves to be the onely Church, by their paucity; which the leaſt number of the never-agreeing, and ſubdivided Brethren may appropriate to themſelves; excluding by that argument all the Churches of the world beſides, yea even their own fellow-ſchiſmaticks) yet this I will be bold to ſay, that many places of the Prophets in the old Teſtament, and many in the New, did and do fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifie, that great abundance of men, women, and children of all nations, of all places, ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt; that there ſhall be (as it were) <hi>Mundus hominum electorum, A world of elect men, a great multitude of men, which no man could number,</hi> Rev. 7.9.</p>
               <p>Unto which number of humane ſouls, if we annex thoſe <hi>thouſand thouſands</hi> of Angels, <hi>and ten thouſand times ten thouſand,</hi> Daniel 7.10. even that innumerable hoſt alſo; we may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently averre, what Eliſhah ſaid of the bleſſed Angels in an other caſe, 2.

The limitation of the word <hi>Omnis</hi> is frequent in Scriptures; not comprehending generally, or univerſally every one in all, and all with every one; but being put for a great number, for many: Luke 6.26. <hi>Wo unto you when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you:</hi> where <hi>All</hi> muſt not be tentered and ſtretched to its utmoſt extent; for all and every did never, do never, and never ſhall, ſpeak well of them. So Acts 22.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt be witneſſe unto all men,</hi> ſaith Ananias to S. Paul: which was not accompliſhed, if <hi>All</hi> have no reſtraint. Again, Titus 2.11. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men:</hi> and yet there were then, and now are many, who never ſaw or knew that ſalutiferous or ſaving grace. So here you are to reduce the word <hi>Omnes,</hi> to <hi>omnes ſui; All that are in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Gloſſe. Again, why may not <hi>All</hi> be aſwell taken for <hi>Many</hi> in this our 18 verſ. as <hi>Many</hi> is taken for <hi>All</hi> in the 19 verſe? where it is ſaid, <hi>By one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners:</hi> when all and every one that deſcended ordinarily and naturally from Adam, ſinned in him and by him, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, verſe 12. and proved before, Geneſ. 17.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt be a father of many nations;</hi> which is repeated word for word, Rom. 4.17. and is thus varied, Geneſ. 22.18. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> and this is confirmed, Galat. 3.8. where <hi>Many</hi> and <hi>All</hi> differ not in ſenſe and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Omnes homines, All men,</hi> you may underſtand <hi>Humanum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Mankinde;</hi> and becauſe all mankinde muſt be diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, goats and ſheep; and conſidered according to two eſtates, fallen and repaired; and their different receptacles, the two cities; the one the city of God, the other of the Devil; in the firſt member the word <hi>All</hi> muſt be interpreted generally, without reſtriction; becauſe in it was ſpeech of Adam, by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6913:113"/>whom death came upon all, without exception: but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and oppoſite member, <hi>All</hi> is not to be taken in the ſame amplitude, <hi>ſed juxta rem ſubjectam, But according to the ſubject ſpoken of: All that have grace, and the gift of righteouſneſſe: Omnes vivificandi, All that are to be made alive,</hi> ſaith S.

If this ſeem harſh to any, there is a ſecond interpretation, which came in my minde before ever I had heard or read, that any other thought ſo: and amongſt a whole army of expounders, I never met with any who wholly agreeth with me; and never but one, whoſe opinion, in part, concurreth with mine: and he is Cardinall Tolet, who is found fault withall covertly, by Juſtinian the Jeſuit, and by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſtius, under a generall <hi>Quidam vir doctus, A certain learned man;</hi> and expreſſely by name by Cornelius à Lapide the Jeſuit: whoſe judgement otherwiſe I had been ignorant of, as not having Tolets labours on the Romanes.

               <p n="1">SECT. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond Queſtion, which, from the words of my Text, I propounded, is this: Whether ſuch as have been raiſed from the dead, did die the ſecond time, yea, or no? becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>It is appointed for men once to die.</hi> I ſpeak not of thoſe who have been thought to be dead, and have been ſtretch't out, and yet their ſoul hath been within them; though divers, for divers daies, and upon ſeverall ſickneſſes, have had neither heat, nor breathing diſcernable: but onely of ſuch, who have ſuffered a true ſeparation of their ſouls from their bodies: Whether theſe have again delivered up the ghoſt, and died, I make my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Before I come to mention thoſe whom the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth to be truly raiſed, I hold it not amiſſe, to propound to your view a few ſtories out of other authours. Theodoret, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de fine &amp; judicio,</hi> hath two ſtrange relations. The firſt is out of Plato, of one Armenius: but Clemens Alexandrinus, <hi>Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.</hi> 5. relateth from Zoroaſter himſelf, that it was Zoroaſter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6913:118"/>the ſonne of Armenius; <hi>He who onely, of all the world, laughed ſo ſoon as he was born</hi> (ſaith Plin. 7.16.) <hi>and was ſo famous a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian:</hi> One of theſe two, either father or ſonne, the twelfth day after he and others fell in the battell, and was to be buried, <hi>ante pyram conſtitutus, revixit,</hi> and being come to himſelf, told what he had ſeen <hi>apud inferos:</hi> namely, that his ſoul being divided from his bodie, came with many others, (who died with him) to an admirable and incredible place, in which there were two gulfs, opes, or ruptures of the earth: and two open places of heaven right over them. In the midſt of theſe <hi>hiatus,</hi> or gulfs, judges did fit; who, when judgement was ended, bade the juſt ſouls aſcend by the heavenly opennes and gaps: the judges ſowing on their breaſts, the notes of their judgement. But the ſouls of the wicked men were commanded to go on the left hand, and to be hurried to hell, carrying with them, on their backs, the memoriall of their paſſed life. But as for himſelf, being now come in fight, the judges bade him diligently heare and ſee all things, and tell all thoſe things which were done, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. <hi>Theſe are ſayings worthy of Philoſophy,</hi> ſaith Theodoret.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A ſecond ſtorie is cited in the ſame place, by Theodoret, from Plutarch, among thoſe things which he wrote <hi>De anima. Soſitiles, Heracleon, and I</hi> (ſaith Plutarch) <hi>were preſent, when Antillus told us this, of himſelf: The Phyſicians thought Antillus to be dead: but he came to himſelf, as one out of a deep ſleep, and neither ſaid, nor did any other thing,
<note n="*" place="margin">Quod emetae mentis ſignum poſſit cenſeri.</note> which might argue him to be crazy or light-headed: but he told us, that he was dead, and that he was again revived, and that his death, upon that ſickneſſe, was not altogether irrevocable: but that the meſſengers, who brought him to judgement, were ſharply blamed by their governours, becauſe they brought Antil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in ſtead of Nicandas. Within a while after, Nicandas died, and Antillus recovered life and health.</hi> And Plutarch, in my opinion, ſeemeth to inſinuate, that he was preſent at the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of him. Of both theſe (if each particular were true, that they were dead, and relived) we may boldly averre, that they died again. Neither doth Plato, Plutarch, or Theodoret doubt of it. As ſtrange a ſtorie, though more remote from our ſubject, you ſhall finde in Alexander ab Alexandro, <hi>Genialium dierum,</hi> 6.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4 An other iſtance you ſhall finde in Bellarmine, <hi>De arte bene moriendi, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. taken out of Joannes Climachus, <hi>in ſcala ſua, grad.</hi> 6. who relates thus of a man, that died twice: <hi>In his firſt life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he lived moſt negligently: but dying, and his ſoul being perfectly ſeparated from his bodie, after one houre, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, and he deſired Climachus, and the reſt, to depart. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they walled up the cell, and he lived (as an Anchoret) within the cell, twelve yeares; ſpeaking to no man till he was ready to die again; eating nothing but bread, and drinking water: ſitting ſo, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6913:118"/>aſtoniſhedly revolved thoſe things onely, which he had ſeen in his ſeparation, with ſo earneſt a thought, that he never changed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but continuing in that amazement, ſecretly wept bitterly. When he was at deaths doore the ſecond time, they forced open the entrance into the cell, and coming to him, humbly deſired him to ſpeak ſome words of doctrine. He anſwered nothing but this onely,
<note n="b" place="margin">Nemo qui revera mortis memoriam agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit, peccare unquam poterit.</note> The ſerious remembrance of death will not conſiſt with ſinne.</hi> The like ſtorie you may finde in Venerable Bede.</p>
               <p>All theſe, if they lived again, died again, and roſe not to life immortall. And in this ſenſe is that averred, Wiſd. 2.1. <hi>Never was any man known to have returned from the grave;</hi> viz. not to die again: for otherwiſe, ſome were known to have been raiſed. From theſe I come more eſpecially to ſpeak of ſuch, whom the word of God reporteth to have been raiſed.</p>
               <closer>MOſt gracious God, who didſt breathe into the face of man the breath of life, and at thy pleaſure draweſt it forth again out of his noſtrils; grant that we make ſuch uſe of this preſent life, that we may ſee, love, and enjoy thee in the life eternall, through Jeſus Chriſt our onely Lord and Saviour.

               <p>The firſt ſort again is ſubdivided into ſuch as were raiſed, either before Chriſt was incarnated, or by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>They who were raiſed before Chriſt was born, were three:
<list>
                     <item>1. The widow of Zarephath her ſonne, 1. King. 17.22.</item>
                     <item>2. The Shunammites ſonne, 2. King. 4.35.</item>
                     <item>3. A dead man who was caſt into the grave of Eliſha, <hi>and when he touched the bones of Eliſha, he revived, and ſtood upon his feet,</hi> 2. King. 13.21.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe three were raiſed up to live, and lived to die again. Neither did the intention of ſuch as requeſted to have them raiſed, or of ſuch as raiſed them, aim once, that they ſhould live immortally: but live onely on earth again as other men did, and then die again. Neither did I ever reade any, who held theſe to ariſe to immortall glory: neither ſtands it with reaſon. For that they were once dead and raiſed to life, the Scripture ſaith: and that they muſt either live to this time, or be tranſlated to immortall glorie in their bodies, or die, is as true as Scripture. Now, becauſe there is no ground to ſay, that they yet live, or were tranſlated bodily into heaven; there is good ground to conclude, that again they died.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the firſt of theſe: the Jews think he was Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas the Prophet: and S. Hierome, in his Prologue on Jonas, citeth their opinion, and diſlikes it not. Toſtatus alſo ſaith, <hi>Dïvers others think ſo.</hi> If Jonas were the widow of Zarephath her ſonne, we know that Jonas died afterward: for <hi>the Prophets are dead,</hi> Joh. 8.53. and he was one of the Prophets. And concerning both the firſt and ſecond inſtance, it is thought by many good Authours, that they are pointed at, Heb. 11.35. <hi>The women received their dead raiſed to life again:</hi> or, <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets delivered to the women their dead,</hi> as the Syriack reads it; that is, to converſe with them as formerly, being raiſed not to an eternall, but a temporary reſurrection; and ſo to die again at their appointed times. And to this truth the Text it ſelf giveth in evidence: for it is ſaid in the ſame verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that they might obtain a better reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of holy men there is a double reſurrection; the firſt, and the laſt; the good, and the better. The reſurrection mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beginning of the verſe was good: and <hi>with reference to the former</hi> (ſaith Chryſoſtom) <hi>the latter reſurrection is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the better.</hi> For the former was <hi>temporary,</hi> the latter <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> called alſo <hi>The holy reſurrection</hi> in our book of Common Prayer, in the Epiſtle on the ſixth Sunday after Trinity; though there is no ſubſtantiall ground for the word <hi>holy,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Latine, or Greek, Rom. 6.5. Of the former, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, in his Comment on Hebr. 11.35. ſaith it was rather a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation</hi> then a <hi>reſurrection:</hi> and again,
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſti ſic reſuſcitati, ſunt iterum mortui: Chriſtus autem reſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens ex mortuis, jam non moritur,</hi> Rom. 6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe being raiſed died again, but Chriſt riſing from the dead, dieth no more,</hi> Rom. 6.9.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:6913:119"/>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore <hi>Chriſts reſurrection was</hi> (as Aquinas ſaith, and as it is indeed) <hi>the beginning of the future reſurrection.</hi> Then muſt they needs die again who were raiſed before him. He was the firſt Guide that lead the way to the eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. <hi>He aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.10. Life and immortalitie to light, which were before in darkneſſe. And I think that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may well be thus paraphraſed in that place to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews: <hi>The women deſired that their dead children might be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again,</hi> (1. King. 17.18. 2. King. 4.22, &amp;c.) <hi>and, as a gift they received their dead raiſed to life again, to live with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſire. But others were tortured, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept deliverance, and cared not for the joyes of this life, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment unto death, nor temporary raiſing, that they might obtain the better reſurrection: not to die again, as the others did; but to live for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 But as for the third, Toſtatus ſaith, <hi>He lived a long time, and he was more healthie then he was before he died:</hi> And he giveth this ſound reaſon; <hi>Becauſe what things are done ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, are farre more perfect then they that are done naturally.</hi> Never was there ſo good wine, as the water turned into wine: the choiceneſſe whereof was ſo eaſily diſcerned, even when the palate was cloyed, when the taſte was corrupted and dull'd, towards the end of a feaſt, Joh. 2.10. Now as he lived a long time, ſo out of doubt in the end he died, taſting of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as truely as the Prophet did, whoſe bones before had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</p>
               <closer>O Bleſſed Jeſu, I beg not at thy hands the reuniting of my ſoul unto my body, for a temporary life: but, if it be thy holy will, let the vertue of thy Paſsion raiſe me first, from the death of ſinne, to the life of righteouſneſſe; and from a righteous temporary life, to the life of immortall happineſſe.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next place of my diviſion leadeth me to treat of thoſe whom Chriſt himſelf raiſed. For if Chriſt did give authoritie to his twelve Apoſtles <hi>to raiſe the dead,</hi> Matth. 10.8. though <hi>both in the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter and Theophylact theſe words are wanting,</hi> ſaith Beza: yet did they not, or the Seventie, at their return to him, ſay they had raiſed any, (which he himſelf did ſo ſparingly) though <hi>they healed the ſick,</hi> Mark 6.13. and <hi>the devils were ſubject unto them through his name,</hi> Luk. 10.17. Neither did the Baptiſt, nor any in Chriſts life-time raiſe up any, ſo farre as can be gathered. It was a work he appropriated to his own power, for the act thereof, whileſt he lived; and which he maketh to be an infallible token and proof that he was the Meſſiah; as appeareth by the anſwer of the ambaſſage which Chriſt returned to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt, Luk. 7.22. <hi>The dead are raiſed</hi> by me, or by my power: Therefore I am he that ſhould come. For that is one member of his argument. And indeed (perhaps) he raiſed divers, whom the Scripture hath not particularized: for <hi>he did very many things that are not written,</hi> Joh. 21.25. Yea, <hi>many ſignes truely did he in the preſence of his diſciples, which are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book,</hi> Joh. 20.30. and his Apoſtles after his death did actuate that power, which habitually in his life they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But thoſe that are mentioned to be raiſed by Chriſt, whileſt he lived on earth, are likewiſe three:
<list>
                     <item>1. A Rulers daughter, Matth. 9.25.</item>
                     <item>2. A dead man, the onely ſonne of his mother, Luk. 7.15.</item>
                     <item>3. Lazarus, his friend, Joh. 11.44.</item>
                  </list> And all theſe returned to do their offices, and follow their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in this life; and in the end payed their due to nature, and died again.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:6913:120"/>
               <p>In the firſt we obſerve, that ſhe was a damſel of twelve yeares of age; and being dead, <hi>her ſpirit came again,</hi> Luk. 8.55. <hi>She aroſe and walked,</hi> Mark 5.42. and <hi>Chriſt commanded to give her meat,</hi> in the ſame place of Luke. And as the meat was commanded to be given her, that they might ſee ſhe was to live ſuch a life as before ſhe lived: ſo, out of doubt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded meat was offered unto her, and ſhe did eat, and was ſtrengthened by it: both living and dying afterwards, as other maids and men did, and no way riſing to immortall life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the ſecond, he was a young man, on whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſt had compaſsion,</hi> Luk. 7.13. She was a widow, the youth her onely ſonne: and when Chriſt touch'd but the coffin, and ſaid, <hi>Young man ariſe;</hi> (that you may ſee both his vertue and his voice had a piercing and quickning power) <hi>he that was dead ſat up, and began to ſpeak; and Chriſt delivered him to his mother,</hi> verſ. 15. Now, theſe are evident ſignes of a naturall life in a naturall body, which muſt yeeld in the end to the ſtroke of death. And the raiſing of this young man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bruited abroad, was the eſpeciall motive why the Baptiſt ſent two diſciples with a meſſage unto Chriſt, Luk. 7.17, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third whom Chriſt raiſed was Lazarus, who had been buried foure dayes ere Chriſt came unto him, Joh. 11.17. (that I may paſſe over the uncertain time from his death to his buriall)
<note n="d" place="margin">Foetens, &amp; quairi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duanut.</note> 
                  <hi>Stinking after foure dayes, enterring,</hi> ſaith S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine: Yet when <hi>Jeſus cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth; he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin: and Jeſus ſaith unto them, Looſe him, and let him go,</hi> Joh. 11.44. In which miracle I finde foure or five wrapped up and involved: That ſo ſuddenly his ſoul did come from its abode: That the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-organized body was ſo ſoon, ſo well prepared: That the ſoul was ſo quickly united; and no ſooner united, then exerciſing her faculties on the bodie, which yeelded ſuch ready obedience: That he could ſee the way out of the grave (and, perchance, approach towards our Saviour) when his eyes were blinded: That he was able to go and walk before he was looſed by them, while his hands and his feet were bound with grave-clothes. Yet that the miracle aimed not to raiſe him to an immortall life, appeareth, becauſe he did not onely go from his grave to Bethanie, to the houſe where his ſiſters, Mary and Martha were; but becauſe he ſupped with our Saviour; he being <hi>one of them that ſat at the table with Jeſus,</hi> Joh. 12.2. where, out of doubt, he did eat as the reſt did.</p>
               <p>There is an argument yet left, as undeniable, as unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. That the then living did think Lazarus lived to die again: For, <hi>the chief Prieſts conſulted that they might put Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus to death,</hi> as well as Chriſt, Joh. 12.10. which they would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6913:121"/>not, they could not have done, if he had not lived, and could not die like other men; if he had been raiſed to life immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: and they knew he was once raiſed, Joh. 11.45, 47.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning the ſick that were healed, and the dead raiſed by Chriſt, worthy Writers further agree, that Chriſt did <hi>integram corporis ſanitatem conferre, omni infirmitate rejectâ, Left no reliques of ſickneſſe or infirmity when he healed.</hi> Chriſt never healed any one man twice, Joh. 7.23. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Totum hominem ſanum feci, I made a man every whit whole; Healed a man wholly,</hi> ſay the Rhemiſts. Perhaps I may adde, that Chriſt never healed the body of any, but he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſoul likewiſe, at leaſt for the inſtant time. I am ſure Chryſoſtom, Auguſtine, and Beda to this purpoſe ſay, The ſame man was healed by Chriſt, Joh. 5.14. <hi>Qui foris ab infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate, ipſe etiam intus ſalvavit à ſcelere:</hi> He ſaved the man from outward infirmitie and inward ſinne: He healed (as I may comment on the words) his body at the pool of Betheſda, his ſoul in the Temple. Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>Totum hominem ſanum feci, I have healed the whole man:</hi> and Beza on Joh. 7.23. ſaith, <hi>He was healed both ſoul and body: Corporaliter &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Both bodily and ghoſtly,</hi> ſaith Hugo Cardinalis. Even he, who was impotent, and had an infirmity thirty eight yeares, upon Chriſts command <hi>immediately was made whole, and took up his bed and walked,</hi> Joh. 5.9. <hi>and immediately,</hi> upon Chriſts word, <hi>the blinde received his ſight,</hi> Mark 10.52. the deaf and ill-ſpeaking man, after Chriſt had ſaid, EPHPHATHA, <hi>his eares were ſtraightway opened, and the ſtring of his tongue was looſed, and he ſpake plain,</hi> Mark 7.35. <hi>The fever immediately left Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wives mother, after Chriſt took her by the hand, and lift her up: and ſhe miniſtred unto them,</hi> Mark 1.31. Chriſt left no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of any old diſeaſe; and whom he healed of any one infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, we never read that he complained of any other. So though Lazarus before his death, was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Languens, longâ infirmitate fractus, actu aegrotus, Pining, feeble, ſick,</hi> ſaith Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: yet was he immediately and perfectly cured: and (as I imagine) he was upon his reſuſcitation, not onely <hi>in latitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſanitatis, Void of all weakneſſe;</hi> ſo that no part was ſick or miſ-affected by any dyſcraſie: but <hi>in perfectione ſalutis, In full compleat health;</hi> and had obtained by Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The height and fulneſſe of health; a conſtant, ſetled, habituall ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in each part of his body.</hi> For as art is but the ape of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and naturall things are farre more abſolute and perfect then artificiall: ſo things miraculous as much exceed things naturall in perfection. So that no naturall <hi>craſis,</hi> no temper or temperature, no health is ſo pure and exact, as that which is wrought immediately by a divine finger: In the vigour and ſtrength whereof Lazarus might have lived, as Adam and Eve did, a long time.</p>

What do I ſpeak of likelihoods, or poſſibilities, when we have good Authours which give us more light concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lazarus his life, and concerning his death? <hi>There is a manuſcript of the Engliſh hiſtorie in the Vatican at Rome, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That about the</hi> 35 <hi>yeare of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith Baronius on the ſame yeare) <hi>Lazarus, Marie Magdalene, and Martha, with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella their waiting-woman, with Maximinus their diſciple, with Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph of Arimathea their companion,

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow am I come to ſpeak of thoſe, who after Chriſts aſcenſion were raiſed. For though in his life time, none of Chriſts inwardeſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or friends raiſed any; (as Eliſha's ſervant could not raiſe the Shunammites ſonne, but Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha himſelf muſt do it, and did it, 2. King. 4.31, &amp;c. And Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6913:122"/>himſelf raiſed none, while his maſter Elijah lived, but Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah himſelf did it, 1. King. 17.22.) yet after Chriſts aſcenſion, by his power communicated to them, <hi>the beleever ſhall do the works that I do, and greater works then theſe ſhall he do,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Joh. 14.12. One was raiſed by S. Peter, an other by S. Paul. You ſhall finde the firſt, Act. 9.40. When Peter had <hi>kneeled and prayed, and turned him to Tabitha her body,</hi> and <hi>ſaid, Tabitha, ariſe; ſhe opened her eyes, and when ſhe ſaw Peter, ſhe ſat up.</hi> Yet was ſhe dead before, and waſht, and laid in an upper chamber, verſ. 37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the other, the ſtorie is this, Act. 20.9. <hi>As Paul was long preaching, Eutychus ſunk down with ſleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead:</hi> perchance broken in ſome parts of his bodie; bruiſed certainly: him S. Paul raiſed, and <hi>they brought the young man alive, and were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comforted,</hi> verſ. 12. Of theſe two, as well as of the reſt, there is no doubt but that they lived again, again to die. So thinks Aquinas, 3. <hi>part. Summ. Quaeſt.</hi> 53. <hi>Artic.</hi> 3. and the whole School (following him) agree with us in this. So Suarez, Lorinus, who not? Take one of the ancients for all: Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian reckoneth up thoſe who were raiſed in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and others raiſed by Chriſts command; and ſaith of theſe,
<note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>They lived a while, and died again:</hi> and a little before of them in the Old Teſtament,
<note n="i" place="margin">Ad mortem quam guſtaverunt iterum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierunt.</note> 
                  <hi>They taſted of death the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</hi> And therefore it needs the leſſe proof, becauſe none denieth it: and the contrary needeth the leſſe diſproof, becauſe none hath averred it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now it is time to come to the third and laſt part of my main firſt diviſion, and to ſpeak of them who aroſe about the time that Chriſt died; for of them there is a deep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate queſtion: and the hiſtorie of them is ſet down at large by the Evangeliſt, Matth. 27.52, and 53 verſes: <hi>The graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</hi> So farre the text. Of the various pointing of which words ſee more hereafter, opening two windows for two expoſitions. On which words, divers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, both modern and ancient, conclude, That thoſe Saints died not again,

                  <hi>But appeared to many, and, with Chriſt, never after were to die, but went into heaven,</hi> ſaith Jacobus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Stapulenſis. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Beza on this place opineth, that they did not riſe, that again they might live among men, and die as Lazarus and others did: but that they might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Chriſt, by whoſe power they roſe, into eternall life. <hi>The late Writers</hi> (ſaith Maldonate) <hi>think, that they went into heaven with Chriſt:</hi> and with them doth himſelf agree.

And he giveth this congruentiall reaſon, That Adam, who heard the ſentence of death, ſhould preſently alſo be partaker of the reſurrection by Chriſt, and with him, who had expiated his ſinne by death. To which may be added, That (as S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom reports) the Jews have a tradition, that the ramme was ſlain on mount Calvarie in ſtead of Iſaac; as alſo Auguſtine <hi>(Serm.</hi> 71. <hi>de Tempore)</hi> ratifieth.

               <p n="6">6. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> George Sands, in the relation of his journey, pag. 163. reporteth, that <hi>on the left ſide of an altar, in mount Calvarie, there is a clift in the rock, in the which they ſay, that the head of Adam was found, and (as they will have it) there buried, (others ſay in Hebron) that his bones might be ſprinkled with the reall bloud of our Saviour; which he knew ſhould be ſhed in that place, by a propheticall fore-knowledge.</hi> And in the next page, he picturing out the chappels, and ſeverall monuments, hath honoured that clift, where they ſay the head of Adam was found, with a locall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it may be thought, that the floud did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſepulchres, houſes, and monuments, and Adams among the reſt; Moſes Barcepha, in his book <hi>de Paradiſo,</hi> excellently ſecondeth Theophylact, and ſaith, That Noah, fore-knowing the floud, took into the ark with him, the bones of Adam; <hi>And (having tripartitely divided the world unto his three ſonnes,</hi> ſaith Epiphanius <hi>in Anchorato,</hi> neare the end; <hi>all Aſia even to Egypt, unto Sem; Africa unto Cham; Europe to Japheth) he gave to Sem, the head or skull of Adam, who, burying it in the old grave, called the place Calvaria.</hi>

                  <hi>It is corruptly written in our copies ARBOCH; ſince in the Hebrew it is read ARBEE, that is, Foure: becauſe there the foure Patriarchs, Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob were buried, and the great Adam, as it is written in the book of Joſhua; though ſome ſuppoſe Adam to be buried in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varie.</hi> The ſame Adrichomius, pag. 46. deſcribeth a double cave in the tribe of Judah; which cave, with the ground and trees, Abraham bought of the ſonnes of Heth, in which were buried Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Iſaac and Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Jacob and Leah, which <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> continued till the time of S. Hierom. Now this place was cloſe by Hebron; and Hebron and this ſepulchre farre from mount Calvarie; 250 <hi>ſtadia,</hi> or there-abouts. Laſtly, ſaith Hierom, <hi>If any will ſtrive that Chriſt was crucified in Calvarie, that his bloud might diſtill on the tombe of Adam; I will ask him, why others, even theeves were there crucified?</hi> The force of theſe authorities, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is not ſuch, as to remove me from the common opinion, that Adam was buried in Golgotha. And thus I anſwer the Objections in order.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine, <hi>de Amiſsione gratiae, &amp; ſtatu peccati,</hi> 3.12. bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Hierom againſt Hierom, and wondreth at his doubling: and he refuteth Hieroms arguments; and produceth many ſtrange proofs, that Adam was buried in mount Calvarie. But I deſcend to the particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt is, a miſtaken imputation of S. Hierom. For who ſaith, or ever ſaid, that the word <hi>Calvaria</hi> ſignified the ſepulchre of the firſt man? Neither can any man primarily argue from the names of <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or <hi>Calvaria,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Calvariae locus, The place of a skull,</hi> that Adam was there bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: nor yet doth <hi>Calvaria</hi> ſignifie <hi>locum decollatorum,</hi> though Hierom would have it ſo. But ſince <hi>Calvaria,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, properly and natively, is truely tranſlated <hi>a skull, the skull of a man;</hi> and GOLGOTHA, <hi>the place of a skull,</hi> Matth. 27.33. not <hi>of skuls,</hi> or <hi>beheaded men,</hi> in the plurall number, (for it is in the ſingular, in every of the Evangeliſts) and conſtant Tradition hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that Adam was there buried; we may conclude, not from the name to Adams buriall; but from the received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Adams buriall in that place, unto the name; and may ſay, with divers Fathers, more then probably, It was termed <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or <hi>the place of a skull,</hi> with reference to Adams bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, or his skull.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, S. Hierom groundeth his ſecond reaſon on the ſands, and offereth violence to the place of Scripture. Thus he readeth it, Joſh. 14.15. <hi>Nomen Hebron antè vocaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6913:127"/>Cariath-Arbee; Adam maximus ibi inter Enacim ſitus eſt: He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron was before called Cariath-Arbee; The firſt Adam was there placed among the Anakims.</hi> Whence he concludeth, That Adam was buried by Hebron and Arbee, and ſo not on mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varie: for they were many miles diſtant each from other.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that neither the Seventy nor Hebrew have, <hi>Ibi ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt.</hi> Secondly, what had Adam our Protoplaſt to do, or to be buried among the Anakims? Wiſer Baronius in the place above-cited, miſliking Hierom, makes the giants name in that place of Joſhua, to be Adam: and not the firſt Adam to be one of the giants, or to be buried with them. Thirdly, both Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom and Baronius are deceived, in thinking that <hi>Adam</hi> in that place is a proper name; for the words may, yea muſt runne thus according to the Hebrew, and is ſeconded by our later tranſlation; <hi>The name of Hebron before, Kirjath-Arba, who was</hi> (or <hi>which Arba) was a great man, among the Anakims.</hi> Now it were non-ſenſe to ſay, <hi>The name of Hebron, was the citie of foure, who was a great man among the Anakims:</hi> and as ſenſeleſſe were it, Joſh. 15.13. to reade it, <hi>Caleb had the citie of foure, the father of Anak:</hi> But taking <hi>Arba,</hi> for the proper name of a man, and the citie ſo called of him; the ſenſe, reaſon, and truth are all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. <hi>A great man, of whom the citie was ſo called,</hi> ſaith Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius: <hi>Arba was the name of a great man among the giants,</hi> ſaith Aben Ezra: <hi>Homo maximus,</hi> ſaith Andrew Maſius: <hi>The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and chiefeſt among the giants,</hi> ſaith Vatablus in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, and Emmanuel Sa in his notes on the place. This <hi>Arba</hi> was <hi>the father of Anak,</hi> Joſh. 21.11. <hi>And the ſonnes of Anak were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and came of giants; and we were,</hi> (ſay the Iſraelites) <hi>in their and in our own ſight as graſhoppers,</hi> Num. 13.33. And this alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects an anſwer upon the third objection of Adrichomius, who though he be moſt accurate in other things, yet here he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep. For though <hi>Arbee</hi> ſignifie <hi>foure,</hi> when <hi>Arbee</hi> is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name; and <hi>Kiriath-arbee</hi> may be rendered, <hi>The citie of foure;</hi> yet it may alſo ſignifie <hi>The citie of one Arba,</hi> or <hi>Arbee:</hi> and ſo <hi>Kiriath-Arbee</hi> in Hebrew is no more, then <hi>Arbepolis</hi> in Greek; ſo called of one Arbee, who was a man, <hi>The father of Anak,</hi> Joſh. 21.11. as I proved before: as <hi>Perſepolis, Adrianopolis, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolis, Alexandrinopolis</hi> in India (as Appian Alexandrinus hath it in his book of the Romane warres with the Syrians) and <hi>Alexandropolis,</hi> a citie of Parthia, as Plinius 6.25. varieth it. So <hi>Magnopolis,</hi> as Appian calleth one citie, in his book of the Romane warres with Mithridates; and <hi>Pompeiopolis,</hi> a citie of Cilicia: both of theſe ſo ſtyled of Pompey the great: though the latter loſt its name, and was after (at the beſt of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and at its greateſt growth) called TRAjANOPOLIS, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Trajan died there,</hi> ſaith Solinus.

                  <hi>viz.</hi> of Mambre, who was Abrahams friend and confederate, Geneſ. 14.13. of Arbee, a great giant (as I proved before) of Hebron, one of Calebs ſonnes ſo called, 1. Chron. 2.42. But how in Jacobs time (or perhaps in Moſes time, who wrote the book of Geneſis) it might be called Hebron of Calebs unborn ſonne, is difficult to conceive, unleſſe by propheticall anticipation. Howſoever, Adrichomius ſaith word for word out of Hierom,
<note n="g" place="margin">Hebron, ab uno fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum caleb, ſortita eſt vocabulum.</note> 
                  <hi>Hebron was ſo called from one of the ſonnes of Caleb.</hi> I ſhould rather think, Caleb himſelf, well known to Moſes, might be the fourth man, of whom the citie might be called <hi>Civitas quatuor hominum, The citie of foure men,</hi> if from men it had its denomination of <hi>Kiriath-arba:</hi> For <hi>Joſuah gave unto Caleb, Hebron for an inheritance,</hi> Joſh. 14.13. and becauſe he drove thence the three famous giants, the grand-children of Arba, <hi>the ſonnes of Anak; Sheſhai, Ahiman, and Talmi,</hi> Joſh. 15.14. for Conquerours left their names unto the cities which they overcame, 2. Sam. 12.28. Neither is it unlikely, but Caleb might call his ſonne <hi>Hebron,</hi> after the name of the citie bequeathed him, rather then the citie, after his ſonnes name, eſpecially, ſince there is mention of a citie <hi>Hebron</hi> before there is any mention of a man <hi>Hebron,</hi> or of Caleb himſelf.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I reade of an other expoſition given by Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Trecenſis, that it might be called <hi>Civitas quatuor virorum, The citie of foure men,</hi> from Anak and his three monſtrous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-recited ſonnes, who dwelt there. For both cities and lands have been called after the names of giants: as Aſhtaroſh, <hi>aliàs</hi> Haſhtaroth, Aſeroth, and Aſtaroth-Carnaim, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim-Aſtradoth in the confines of the land of Hus was a great citie, inhabited by giants called Carnaim, or Rephaim (and <hi>the place,</hi> ſaith Adrichomius, <hi>was called</hi> TERRA GIGAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUM) whom Chedorlaomer killed when in the time of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham he led an armie, and fought againſt the king of Sodom, Geneſ. 14.5.

               <p n="7">7. Grant we yet once again, more then we need, that it was called <hi>Kiriath-arbee</hi> from foure Patriarchs, yea and from the buriall of foure Patriarchs in that place (which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be proved;) yet it is not evinced, nor will follow neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that Adam was one of theſe foure Patriarchs there bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. S. Hierom, <hi>in Epitaph. ſanct. Paulae,</hi> ſaith, Kiriath-arbee was
<note n="h" place="margin">Oppidum quatuor virorum.</note> 
                  <hi>The town of foure men,</hi> of Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, and the

                  <hi>moſt think Caleb was the fourth man, whoſe rib is a memoriall.</hi> And Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius himſelf makes the ſepulchre of Caleb not farre from Hebron. The opinion of Adams being there buried, is father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Jews: the common Tenet was, that Caleb was the fourth man. Probabilitie alſo conſorteth therewith: for if Adam had been there buried; as Abraham could not have been ignorant thereof, ſo he would, in that regard, have the rather bought that place, and perhaps would have given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of it to the children of Heth. But as it ſhould ſeem, Abraham ſtood indifferent at the firſt, and ſaid onely, <hi>Give me a poſſeſsion of a burying-place with you,</hi> Geneſ. 23.4. And when they offered him any of their ſepulchres, he choſe the cave of Machpelah. To conclude, the objection of Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius is thus anſwered: Kiriath-Arbee may ſignifie the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Arbee; or the citie of foure things noted and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; or the citie of foure angles, ſides, or parts; the citie ſited on foure hills; and if it be to be interpreted, <hi>Civitas quatuor hominum, A citie of foure men,</hi> the foure men may be, Heth, Mambre, Arbe, and Caleb; or Anak and his three monſtrous ſonnes. Howſoever, the word proves not, that foure men were there buried: and if it proved ſo much, yet Adam was none of theſe foure; for Adam was not buried in Hebron, but in mount Calvarie, as I proved before to the full, and yet ſhall adde more by and by.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To the laſt and fourth objection of S. Hierom, being a demand, why others even theeves were there buried? I anſwer, Though Adam were there buried, yet what hindered, but it might be a fit place for malefactours to be executed, eſpecially being on high, and without the walls of the citie? and both theeves might there ſuffer as in a place appointed for ſuch uſe by the Magiſtrate; and Chriſt might there die, as appointed by the ſecret providence of God, beyond the reach of man, that the bloud of the ſecond Adam might fall on the ſepulchre of the firſt Adam, and other ſinners: to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that the water and bloud flowing from Chriſt, did purge even the greateſt malefactours, Adam, and the notorious ſonnes of Adam.

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. An objection more, Franciſcus Lucas Brugenſis toucheth at, againſt this opinion: namely, that if the Jews had known that Adams ſepulchre was on that mount Calvarie, they would have had the place in farre greater eſteem; they would have deckt it with ſome ſtately monument; and never have ſuffered the malefactours inordinately there to be executed. The former part of which objection, as I do ſtrengthen by Matth. 23.29. <hi>Ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and garniſh the tombes of the righteous,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees: ſo to it I anſwer thus; That there is not the leaſt touch in Scripture, nor in any Authour, that I remember, that the Jews ever regarded or honoured Adam, or held him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or gloried in him above others: nay, they thought ill of him, 2. Eſdr. 3.21. &amp;c. and 2. Eſdr. 4.30. and finde fault with him 2. Eſdr. 7.48. <hi>O thou Adam, what haſt thou done? for though it was thou that ſinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee.</hi> And a little before, namely verſe 46. <hi>This is my firſt and laſt ſaying, that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam; or elſe when it was given him, to have reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from ſinning.</hi> Mark alſo the Antitheſis uſed Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus 49.16. <hi>Sem and Seth were in great honour among men; and ſo was Adam above every living thing in the creation:</hi> where he remarkably extolleth Sem and Seth; but praiſeth Adams excellencie onely at the creation: And ſo Vatablus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it. Howſoever, after his fall he was not ſo highly eſteemed as others were. No more did the multitude ſhew any extraordinary eſtimate of Noah, though as Adam was the fruitfull root, the protoplaſt; ſo Noah was the reſtorer of mankinde, under God: For theſe were the founders as well of Gentiles as Jews. But Abraham, and the Patriarchs, and the Prophets ſince them, they reverenced above meaſure, for the extraordinary bleſſings vouchſafed by God unto the Jews above the Gentiles for their ſakes, and in them, and by them. Now to ſuch indeed their poſteritie builded tombes, Matth. 23.30. though their fathers had killed ſome of them.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond part of the objection, <hi>Why they did ſuffer malefactours to be there puniſhed;</hi> I anſwer, that it is a doubt undecided, whether the ordinary delinquents were put to death on mount Calvarie, before the Romanes overcame the Jews. If not, then patience perforce; they could not remedie it, if the other appointed it. If ſo, yet the Jews might be ignorant of Adams ſepulchre: and how could they grace
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6913:131"/>and beautifie his tombe, when they knew not where he lay? Again, what if I ſay, That like as Gods eternall decree and determinate counſel being, that Chriſt ſhould die for our ſinnes, the Jews and Gentiles, Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees, yea the devils themſelves were, for a while and a time, blinded, that they knew not, or would not know Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, though they had more evident miraculous proofs of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then could be of a buriall-place, ſo long fore-paſſed, as Adams was; but put him to death, Act. 2.23. and chap. 3.17. So Gods eternall decree, that Chriſt ſhould be crucified in the execution-place of malefactours, and in the place of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams ſepulchre, being (perhaps) to this end, to manifeſt, that Chriſts bloud did waſh and purge ſinne originall, ſinne actuall; Adam and notorious offenders, with all and all manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and all, and all kinde of ſinnes; the people were alſo blinded, that either they did not know, or not reſpect the place of Adams buriall; eſpecially ſince God often caſts in their teeth Adams diſobedience, and compared their ſinnes to his; <hi>They, like Adam, have tranſgreſſed the covenant,</hi> Hoſ. 6.7. Where Druſius preferreth this reading with us, with Hierom, with Pagnine, and with Rabbi Solomon, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Interpreter of the Hebrews, before the reading of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Tremellius, and the Genevans. And Jerem. 32.19. <hi>Gods eyes were open to all the wayes of the ſonnes of Adam.</hi> Which is alſo confirmed, Iſa. 43.27. 2. Eſdr. 7.11. Thus much in love of truth, againſt all oppoſites, with Pineda, for the common opinion of the Fathers, that Adam was buried on Golgotha.

For, upon other reaſons hereafter to be ſhewen, I dare not be ſo aſſertive, as the Liturgies of divers Churches, and as divers Fathers, who are expreſſe, that Adam was raiſed from his grave. See them cited by the learned James Uſher, Biſhop of Meath, in his anſwer to a challenge made by a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, pag. 324. — which is the next point to be handled.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut the ſecond part of Pineda his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on Job the 19.25. I cannot like, though he laboureth to prove it, partly by authoritie, partly by reaſon; That thoſe many, who aroſe about the time of Chriſts Paſſion, aſcended bodily into heaven with him. As Authours, he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Athanaſius in his Sermon on the Paſſion and the Croſſe, Origen, &amp;c. That Adam was buried on Golgotha, Athanaſius ſaith; but that Adam aroſe not long after Chriſts reſurrection, I cannot finde in him, or cited by any other out of him. As for Origen his ſecond Authour, in the ſame Tractate cited by Pineda, he maketh directly againſt him: for he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Tradition, that the firſt Adam was buried where Chriſt was crucified: that as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt all ſhould be made alive: that in the place of a skull, the head of mankinde (namely Adam) <hi>Reſurrectionem inveniat cum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo univerſo, Should partake of the generall reſurrection,</hi> by the reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour, who there ſuffered and roſe again. But the laſt and beſt Authour, the divine S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, is palpably and apparently falſified: for he hath no ſuch word in the quoted place. Laſtly, the reaſon that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda alledgeth is ſhallow, That Adam who heard the ſentence of death, ſhould preſently be partaker of the reſurrection by him, and with him, who had ſatisfied for the ſinne. What likelihood is there of inference or coherence? I dare ſay, not one of the Fathers cited at large by Baronius, Salianus, and Maldonate, to prove that Adam was buried in Golgotha, do
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6913:132"/>give the leaſt touch at this reaſon of Pineda; but many other ends of Adams being there buried do they muſter up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the Jeſuite Pineda, either knew it not, or forgot it, or ſleeked it over, as little imagining we ſhould have notice that the cheating prieſts, who kept the ſepulchre, and the Church built over it, at Jeruſalem, did ſhew to the devout Chriſtians a skull, which they ſaid was the skull of Adam: of which, they ſaid alſo, the mountain was called <hi>Golgotha,</hi> as ſaith the eye and eare-witneſſe, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fines Moriſon, in his firſt part, 3. book, 2. chap. pag. 230. and pag. 233. Thus, according to them, Adam either aroſe not hitherto; or aroſe without a head, at leaſt without his skull; or with an other mans head: which three latter wayes deſtroy the truth of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore he aroſe not at all as yet. Laſtly, ſhould we grant that Adam did bodily ariſe with Chriſt; yet hath Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda neither Authour nor reaſon, that Adam aſcended with Chriſt into heaven (as I ſaid before) which is the main point now in queſtion. Thus much (if not too much) touching Adam.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eve alſo aroſe, ſaith Dionyſius Carthuſianus on Matth. 27. but voucheth no authoritie, nor produceth any reaſon, or probabilitie: and therefore I paſſe it over the more ſlightly; adding onely this, that in the Original it is not, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> be underſtood, either no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aroſe, or more then one or two; though Pineda men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth not one woman; and Carthuſian, but onely and ſoly Eve. But why Eve ſhould rather ariſe, then Sarah, or the mother of Moſes, who were ſingled out for famous <hi>Heroinae,</hi> Hebr. 11. or other Prophetiſſes, in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as old Anna, and the like, I ſee no reaſon: or that Eve in her raiſed bodie, ſhould be tranſlated into heaven, and not Adam her husband, nor Abraham, nor David, is both fooliſh and fabulous. This have I ſaid, as ſuppoſing the words to be underſtood of women alone, as indeed they are not; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably can they be applied to women mixt with men, ſo far as any likelihood could preſent it ſelf to the great conjecturer Pineda, who would have balked none of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Abraham aroſe, ſaith Pineda on Job 19. and annexeth this colour, becauſe <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee Chriſts day, and ſaw it, and was glad,</hi> John 8.56. I anſwer, Whatſoever is meant by theſe words of the Text, <hi>My day:</hi> either Chriſts Godhead; which Abraham ſaw,
<note n="a" place="margin">Quia myſterium Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis agnovit.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe he acknowledged the myſterie of the Trinitie,</hi> ſaith S. Auguſtine: Or the day of Chriſts nativitie; which Abraham might have notice of in his life time, by ſupernaturall inſpirations; and then did remember, being dead; and deſired that day (for, ſeparated ſouls have both remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and appetite intellectuall, as I ſhall evidence hereafter:)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6913:132"/>Or it may be, Abraham being in bliſſe, might firſt know it, by divine illumination, ſo ſoon as the day came; and thereupon rejoyced, as the Angel did; and the heavenly hoſt, Luke 2.13. of which hoſt, Abraham might be one: for, <hi>even the ſouls of men are alſo called</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.14. ſaith Gregory, Moral. 31.12. In the foreſaid place of Luke mention is made of an Angel and the heavenly hoſt; whereas, if onely Angels were the heavenly hoſt, it might have been onely ſaid, <hi>The Angels:</hi> or onely, <hi>The heavenly hoſt:</hi> but, <hi>The Angel</hi> and <hi>the heavenly hoſt</hi> may give us cauſe to think, that there were ſome of the heavenly hoſt, which were not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; though Angels onely be mentioned. If ſo; humane ſouls were part of that quire: and then Abraham, in likelihood, was one of them. Now, as the chief Angel, like a chaunter, began the Evangeliſme of Chriſts birth; ſo might it be anſwered by the heavenly hoſt; <hi>viz.</hi> (as is probable) partly by the Angels ſinging <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt;</hi> partly by Abraham, and the ſouls of men, concluding the Anthem, <hi>On earth peace, good will toward men.</hi> I ſay, Whatſoever is meant by the words <hi>My day,</hi> they cannot be expounded of Chriſts reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Some there are, who interpret <hi>My day,</hi> of the time of Chriſts paſſion; whom Maldonate juſtly miſliketh, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is added,</hi> ABRAHAM SAW IT, AND REJOYCED: <hi>but then, when Chriſt ſaid theſe words, Abraham could not ſee Chriſts paſsion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not yet come.</hi> I may ſay the ſame or more, againſt Pineda, who will have it expounded of the day of Chriſts reſurrection: for, Chriſt ſpeaketh of the day that was paſt, he <hi>did ſee it,</hi> he <hi>was glad,</hi> and <hi>rejoyced:</hi> ſo that day was ended, when Chriſt ſaid this: but Chriſts reſurrection was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, when he uttered theſe words: therefore they cannot be underſtood of Chriſts reſurrection. And if they were ſo to be interpreted, yet it is not written, <hi>Abraham aroſe,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was partaker with Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Abraham aſcended bodily into heaven</hi> (this being the iſſue, which we joyned, in this controverſie:) but, <hi>Abraham rejoyced, he ſaw it, and was glad:</hi> which words differ farre from Pineda his ridiculous interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>An other, which roſe at the ſame time, was Iſaac</hi> (ſaith Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda, ibid.) <hi>for he was a parable of the reſurrection; and this was done, to recompenſe the fear (which poſſeſſed Iſaac) of being ſlain, when he repreſented Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>puncto</hi> I anſwer; Pineda himſelf will not ſay, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, who was a parable, or pledge of the reſurrection, or who figured it, was raiſed; as Samſon from his ſleep, ariſing in ſtrength, and carrying away the gates of Azzah, in type of Chriſt, who brought away the gates both of death and hell: or thoſe, who were raiſed by the Prophets, or by Chriſt himſelf, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6913:133"/>the like; for he mentioneth none of theſe. Secondly, what proof, what conſequence, what ſhadow of truth is there, that Iſaac his fear, which was paſt (he being dead one thouſand ſeven hundred yeares before) ſhould juſt now be recompenſed, and recompenſed by being raiſed to a temporall life? which was a poore reward, if he aſcended not into heaven: which Pineda proveth not, nor can prove. Laſtly, though it be truth it ſelf, that Jacob <hi>ſware by the fear of his father Iſaac,</hi> Geneſ. 31.53. yet it is not meant, as Pineda fancieth, the fear that Iſaac was in, when he was to be offered. For (I ſuppoſe) he knew by Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, that it was Gods eſpeciall appointment; and that he alſo willingly offered himſelf; and might think (as Abraham did) <hi>that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead,</hi> Hebr. 11.19. that in his voluntarie condeſcent, and free-will-offering, he might be a type of Chriſt, who <hi>layed down his life,</hi> John 10.17. But the fear of Iſaac was either the filial fear, by which Iſaac reverenced &amp; worſhipped God, (as Aben Ezra and Cajetan ſay) or the pious and humane fear, wherewith Jacob revered his father Iſaac: or ratheſt of all, <hi>Fear</hi> is here taken for the object of fear, Metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, for God himſelf: as it is alſo taken, Eſa. 8.13. <hi>Let God be your fear; let God be your dread;</hi> as Cornelius Cornelii à lapide hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, after Auguſtine, and divers others: for, not Iſaac his fright, or Jacob his pietie, is to be ſworn by, but <hi>God,</hi> Deuter. 6.13.</p>
               <closer>O God, the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, the God of the living, and not of the dead; I beſeech thee, make me to die to my ſelf, and live to thee; through him, whom the Fathers look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and whoſe day Abraham rejoyced to ſee, even Jeſus Chriſt, thy onely Sonne, my alone Saviour.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>Acob then alſo aroſe,</hi> ſaith Pineda in the ſame place; <hi>ſince he had a great care of tranſlating his bones, out of Egypt, into the land of Canaan,</hi> Geneſ. 49.29. By the ſame reaſon, the Jeſuit might have argued, that Joſeph then alſo aroſe: for he had the like care of his bones, Geneſ. 50.25. yea a greater care: for he took a ſtrict oath (Exod. 13.19.) of the children of Iſrael, for the performance of his deſire; whereas Jacob put Joſeph onely to the oath; and concerning the reſt of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it was but a fatherly command. Yet Pineda skippeth over Joſeph, who was a lively parable and figure of Chriſt in moſt things; as being the beſt beloved of his father; as being ſent to look to his brethren; as hated of them and ſold by them, and put into the pit; as thruſt into the dungeon; as being innocent, and falſly accuſed; as being taken <hi>out of the pit,</hi> Geneſ. 37.28. and <hi>out of the dungeon,</hi> Geneſ. 41.14. as raiſed, and raiſed to be next to Pharaoh himſelf; as being worſhipped by his brethren; as having the double portion of the firſt-born; as a mediatour for his brethren, and a preſerver of them in the time of need.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the truth is, neither Jacob, nor Joſeph ever deſired the removal of their bones, in that regard, which Pineda aimeth at: and never any (that I could reade) but he, and the Authour of the ſcholaſticall hiſtorie, <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 100 <hi>in Geneſ.</hi> averre ſo much: it being againſt reaſon; for then the Patriarchs would have cauſed their bones to have been tranſlated to Jeruſalem, being the right way from Hebron to Calvarie; or to mount Calvarie itſelf. But Jacob was buried by Hebron, thirtie miles, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, from Golgotha; and Joſeph was buried in the Tribe of Ephraim, and not of Judah. Now as they were to paſſe from the land of Goſhen to Sychem, they muſt paſſe not farre from Hebron; and from thence neare to Jeruſalem; and leaving Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and mount Calvarie but a little, the way was to Sychem, in the Tribe of Ephraim. Therefore, if they deſired to be tranſlated, in hope of ſuch a reſurrection with Chriſt, (as Pineda wildely imagineth) they would never have carried their bones cloſe by mount Calvarie, and ſo beyond it; but there would
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6913:134"/>have depoſited them: nor would have tranſported them to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, which was about as farre beyond the ſepulchre of the firſt and ſecond Adam, as Hebron, the buriall-place of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob, was ſhort of mount Calvarie. Their aim was to be buried in the land of Canaan, as the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as the figure of heaven, as the ground which their Fathers bought and payd for, and were interred in. <hi>I will lie with my Fathers, and thou ſhalt carrie me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place,</hi> ſaith Jacob, Geneſ. 47.30. and <hi>bury me with my Fathers,</hi> Geneſ. 49.29. ſaith the ſame Jacob. Beſides, if with reference to Chriſt his reſurrection, and in hope to be then and there raiſed by him and with him, they removed their bones into Canaan; it was to be neare to Chriſts riſing-place, and to ſave part of the long journey from Goſhen to Golgotha. But this can be no reaſon; for <hi>Job aroſe,</hi> ſaith Pineda: but he was buried in the land of Hus, in Arabia, not neare unto Calvarie, though not ſo farre indeed as Goſhen. And Moſes died in the wilderneſſe; and Daniel in the captivitie of Babylon; which was farther off, then the land of Goſhen, from Chriſts ſepulchre, by almoſt five hundred miles; and yet <hi>Daniel and Moſes aroſe alſo,</hi> ſaith Pineda. And Noah died hard by mount Ararat in Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, 600 miles North-ward from Jeruſalem, or thereabout: yet <hi>Noah alſo aroſe,</hi> ſaith Pineda. Now, why could not Jacob and Joſeph be raiſed, and come a ſhorter way, from Goſhen to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, then Daniel or Noah could a longer way? And to beat Pineda with his own words,
<note n="a" place="margin">Nunquid laſſitudine viae deterrerentur &amp; fatigarentur, qui im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortali vitâ potieban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; ut venire ex regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one longin qua opportunè non poſſent?</note> 
                  <hi>Were they terrified or wearied with the tediouſneſſe of the way, who enjoyed an immortall life; that they could not come fitly from ſo remote a region?</hi> Or, <hi>can they be truelier ſaid to come into a place, into the holy citie, that come from neare, then they that come from farre?</hi> This Pineda alledgeth, to prove that the graves of Saints opened afarre off, as well as at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: Therefore ſay I, What need they care to have their bones brought neare to Golgotha, to that end and purpoſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Concerning Joſeph, <hi>he was firſt buried on an high ground, upon a little branch of Nilus, in a citie now called</hi> EL-FIUM (ſaith John Leo, upon report, in his eighth book of the hiſtorie of Africa) <hi>and Moſes digged up his bones.</hi> Secondly, it is ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, Joſh. 24.32. <hi>the children of Iſrael buried his bones in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the ſonnes of Hemor, the father of Sychem, for an hundred pieces of ſilver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joſeph.</hi> On which place, Maſius inquiring, <hi>why holy men ſhould ſo earneſtly contend to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Canaan,</hi> anſwereth himſelf,

Kimki ſaith (and Maſius likes it) that Jacob gave to Joſeph that place of buriall, becauſe he being, as it were, the Parent, Monitour, and Guide of his brethren, ſhould be wholly alienated from Egyptian affairs, to think of the land of promiſe. And ſince Maſius taxeth the Jews for thinking, that they who were buried in Canaan ſhould firſt ariſe; he would have laughed at Pineda, if he had read in him, that a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch cauſed his bones to be tranſlated, in hope to be raiſed within a while of Chriſts reſurrection.

               <p>That this is a knot hard to be untied, all confeſſe: <hi>S. Hierom promiſed in his</hi> 101 <hi>Epiſt. to clear it,</hi> ſaith Lorinus: And <hi>in his Queſtions on Geneſ.</hi> ſaith Beza: but <hi>he hath not performed his promiſe,</hi> ſay both of them, on Acts 7. <hi>Nodum nectit Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6913:135"/>nec eum diſſolvit,</hi> ſaith Eraſmus: And <hi>I onely propound it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the ſtudious reader may be ſtirred up to diſcuſſe it.</hi> But this is a ſhallow ſlurre, unfit for ſo great a Critick; for many had done ſo much before, and more then ſo. I come to the point.</p>
               <p>That there are invented many wayes, and means of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot be denied: but ſome are vaſt and improbable; ſome more fair and expedite. The abſurd anſwers are two. The firſt, That the Originall is there corrupt; and that, for Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob is to be written and read; I ſay, not meant, expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or interpreted, but exchanged, and intruded into the Text; and that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhould be expunged, as needleſſe; <hi>it being with equall ignorance and boldneſſe, added by one or other,</hi> ſaith Andrew Maſius on Joſh. 24.32. With Maſius agreeth Beza in this, that the name of <hi>Abraham</hi> is crept into the Text; adding, that <hi>the erring, in notes of number, or proper names, muſt not be aſcribed to the Authours; but to the ignorant tranſcribers.</hi> But I ſay, that the erring in a proper name, or notes of number, may breed as great and unſufferable confuſion, unlikelihood, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, yea untruth, as the errour in any other common word. And why the errours in proper names ſhould be aſcribed to ignorant tranſcribers, rather then errours in other words; or that the holy Spirit doth priviledge other words, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names, or numbers, from being miſtaken, miſplaced, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added, or ſuperadded in the Text, I ſee not.</p>
               <p>Aretius bluntly blundereth it out, that you muſt underſtand <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Abraham:</hi> yet by what example, or for what reaſon, he mentioneth not: but ſtumbleth on a truth; of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>Druſius, <hi>Praeterit. lib.</hi> 5. on the words <hi>Quod emit Abraham,</hi> hath yet ſome ſhew of reaſon. <hi>It ſeemeth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times written,</hi> EMIT IPSE, <hi>that is</hi> JACOB, <hi>into whoſe place the name of</hi> ABRAHAM <hi>is crept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Beza defends it by two parallels: the firſt out of Hierom, who in his book <hi>de optimo genere interpretandi, ad Pammachium,</hi> noteth, that the name of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was crept into many copies, on Matth. 13.35. that afterward, the name of <hi>Aſaph</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and now neither of them is there read.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to the miſapplied inſtances of Beza, that I cannot abide to hunt after errours in the Scripture, and to caſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on it. To queſtion the corruption of the Canon, to paſſe our judgements, whether the ſquare or rule be right or crooked, to put into the Text, or to take from it, as ſome Philologizing Neotericks endeavour in their ſuper-nice criticiſme, is to tear up the very foundation of religion. Whileſt other anſwers may be found, though but probable, I ſhould not have ſuch a thought, as Beza had, on Luk. 24.13. where he acknowledgeth, both the Syriack, and all our Copies have it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Sexaginta,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6913:135"/>Threeſcore;</hi> and the exact truth is accordant to that reading: for Emaus is ſeven miles from Jeruſalem, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sands (who rode from Jeruſalem to Emaus) witneſſeth, pag. 174. and threeſcore <hi>Stadia</hi> (allowing eight <hi>Stadia</hi> to a mile) make ſeven miles and an half; which halfe-mile, upon diverſitie of meaſures, or the beginning of meaſuring, or ends thereof, maketh ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Yet Beza ſaith, <hi>Aut hîc peccatum eſt in numero, aut apud Joſephum, de Bello Judaico</hi> 7.27. <hi>non rectè ſcribuntur ſtadia triginta.</hi> The more favourable phraſe ſhould have been by Beza aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed rather to the Scripture, then to Joſephus. Or can we think, that all Copies do erre? He maketh us fight upon the ice, and to have no firm footing. Why ſhould he uſe the firſt part of the disjunction, when he might better diſtinguiſh, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all? Likewiſe Beza, on Luke 22.20. confeſſing the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of reading, both in the Syriack, and all the Greek Copies which he had ſeen; yet addeth boldly, <hi>Aut manifeſtum eſt ſoloecophanes,—aut potiùs, cùm haec eſſent ad marginem annotata ex Matthaeo, &amp; Marco, poſtea in Contextum irrepſerunt.</hi> Now, though he would ſleek it over afterwards, ſaying, <hi>Poteſt excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari ſoloeciſmus, &amp;c.</hi> yet the wound, which he gave to the Word of Truth is too deep, to be ſo healed; and the very plaiſter is offenſive: for he committed a ſoloeciſme, who looking on the <hi>earth,</hi> cried out, <hi>O Coelum!</hi> and caſting his eyes up to <hi>heaven;</hi> cried, <hi>O Terra!</hi> Had the Reverend Beza no handſomer word for his plaiſter? might he not have defended it, by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiotiſme, without calling it a Soloeciſme? <hi>Soloecophanes</hi> might have well been ſpared: but <hi>Soloeciſmus</hi> is not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid: but I dwell unwillingly on this point; and return to the firſt place of Matth. 13.35. and ſay, Who ever denyed, but that ſome Copies have been corrupted? and in ſome of them, ſome words foiſted in? but all Greek, all Latine Copies, with the Arabick and Syriack tranſlations, reade <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not <hi>Jacob:</hi> Whereas ſome Copies were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes perfect, in that place of Matthew. Now, if you grant corruption in any point, or title, in all the Greek, and all the Latine Copies; how will you prove any part or word of the New Teſtament to be uncorrupt? Which razeth up the very Corner-ſtone of our Faith.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beza again objecteth, that the name of <hi>Jeremie</hi> is written for <hi>Zacharie,</hi> Matth. 27.9. I anſwer, that the Authour of the book of Maccabees, giveth us to underſtand, that Jeremie wrote other things, which now we have not, 2. Maccab. 2.1. and ſo did divers of the Prophets: and why may not this be then taken from ſome of thoſe works, which are periſhed? Secondly, S. Hierome ſaith, a Jew brought him an Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall book of Jeremie, in which he found this teſtimonie,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6913:136"/>word for word; and <hi>this book was called</hi> APOCRYPHA, or OC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULTA JEREMIAE, <hi>The Apocryphals or hid writings of Jeremie,</hi> ſaith Eraſmus on Matth. 27. As what S. Paul ſaith of Jannes and Jambres, 2. Tim. 3.8. and what S. Jude ſaith of Michael the Archangel, ſtriving with the Devil, is thought to be taken out of the books Apocryphall: ſo might this teſtimonie be cited alſo out of Jeremies Apocryphals. Thirdly, Eraſmus ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that Zacharie had two names, and was called both Zacharie and Jeremie; and ſo no inconvenience followeth. Fourthly, not onely the Syriack leaves out the name of Jeremie, but even in Auguſtines time, the name of Jeremie was not in many Latine Copies, as Auguſtine himſelf teſtifieth, <hi>de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu Evangeliſtarum lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. The ordinarie gloſſe alſo ſaith, that in ſome editions, it is onely thus, <hi>By the Prophet,</hi> and the name of Jeremie is left unmentioned. Fifthly, Auguſtine in the laſt recited place of his, reſolveth, that the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence purpoſely ſet down <hi>Jeremie</hi> for <hi>Zacharie;</hi> and what the holy Spirit did dictate, S. Matthew did truely write. And <hi>one reaſon why the Spirit of God confounded the names of Jeremie and Zacharie, was this,</hi> ſaith Auguſtine; <hi>To inſinuate, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets wrote by one Spirit, and wonderfully conſented in one; and therefore we muſt beleeve that

                  </gap>, <hi>Search the Scriptures)</hi> is alſo oftentimes called, in the ſingular number, <hi>The Scripture:</hi> as John 2.22. <hi>they beleeved the Scripture, and the word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi> Beleef was to reſt, as well on his Word onely, without Scripture, as on Scripture, though he had ſaid nothing: and the word <hi>Scripture</hi> is not to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to that place of Scripture before pointed at; but to the whole Word of God written, which they beleeved. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under ſinne,</hi> Gal. 3.22. where not one ſingle place onely, but either common places of that point, or the whole bodie of the Scripture is to be underſtood. A few words of a Pſalme of David, is called by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>The law of the Jews; It is written in their law, They hated me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe,</hi> John 15.25. which is onely ſo written, Pſal. 35.19. Again, he ſaith to the Jews, John 10.34. <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I have ſaid, ye are Gods?</hi> but it is written ſo onely, Pſal. 83.6. Yea, though one and the ſame thing in effect be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6913:136"/>written, both Iſa. 28.16. and Pſal. 118.22. as alſo Matth 21.42. and Acts 4.12. yet S. Peter reckoneth all, but as one; All, but one Scripture, though ſeverally written by theſe foure: <hi>It is contained in the Scripture,</hi> (ſaith he) 1. Pet. 2.6. in the ſingular number; he mentioneth Scripture, as if what one wrote the reſt wrote. S. Peter ſaith not, It is contained in the Word, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to one Spirit inditing or inſpiring, (though that might have alſo been truely ſpoken) but contained in the Scripture, with relation to the unity and conſent of the Pen-men. Laſtly, the words of the Evangeliſt are theſe, Matth. 27.9. <hi>Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Jeremie, ſaying, And they took the thirty pieces of ſilver;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Jeremiae, dicentis, That which was ſpoken by Jeremie, ſaying, &amp;c.</hi> Now Jeremiae might ſay it, ſpeak it, dictate it, which is moſt true, and is all that S. Matthew ſaith; who by the Spirit might alſo know, that Jeremie did teach, preach, propheſie, and utter theſe words: and yet for all this, and after all this, Zacharie by the ſame Spirit might write, tranſcribe, and inſert thoſe words of Jeremie into his own Propheſie (which S. Matthew denieth not) as Baruch wrote divers things which he had heard from Jeremie; as Agur collected ſome Proverbs of Solomon. Again, there was no neceſſitie that all things whatſoever Jeremie, as a Prophet, did ſpeak,
<note n="g" place="margin">Jerem. 36.2.</note> he himſelf or Baruch ſhould write, much leſſe preſently: ſince there were many yeares between Jeremie his ſpeaking and his writing; for Enoch propheſied, as it is in the 14. verſe of the Epiſt. of S. Jude; but he propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Saying, &amp;c.</hi> as it is there written: for writing was none, till God ſet the Copie unto Moſes, by writing the Law in the Tables on the mount.</p>
               <p>Again, S. Paul (Act. 24.35.) remembreth the words of our Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, <hi>It is more bleſſed to give, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:</hi> yet none of the Evangeliſts record ſuch words: but this might the Apoſtles relate unto S. Paul; or by divine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he might know that Chriſt ſpake them; or they might be part of the words which Chriſt himſelf ſpake unto S. Paul: for there is no certaintie, that they were written. S. John the Evangeliſt was commanded to conceal, and not to write, the words of the ſeven thunders, Revel. 10.4. If he had wholly concealed ſuch a thing, we could not know it: he ſpake it, but wrote it not. Jeremie might ſpeak this, and not write it; or write it, and not ſpeak it. Any of theſe anſwers is better, then to incline to Beza, that the Text is erroneous, or patched up with a falſe addition; or to Eraſmus, on Matth. 27. intimating, there was <hi>lapſus memoriae in Evangeliſtis:</hi> howſoever he quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth it; That, if there were <hi>memoriae lapſus, in Nomine duntaxat,</hi> he did think no man ſhould be ſo moroſe, noſy, and ſtern, as thence to queſtion the authoritie of the whole Scriptures.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to conclude, neither be the Arabick or Syriack Copies of authoritie enough to confront the Greek (for the Greek was not tranſlated out of them, but they out of the Greek) neither may we yeeld, that either the Evangeliſts did <hi>labi me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriâ, fail in their memories;</hi> or that generally, in any place, all the Greek and Latine Copies are corrupted.

A defender of it is Melchior Canus, <hi>de Locis Theologicis, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. toward the end of that book and chapter. For he would ſeem to gather from Beda and Rabanus, <hi>That it happened to Steven, as to other common people; namely, that in a long narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially if it be ſudden, he hath mingled and confounded ſome things,
<note n="a" place="margin">In quibuſdam etiam memoriâ lapſus fuerit.</note> And forgot himſelf in ſome things, to wit, in ſuch things as belonged little or nothing to the purpoſe: for he was buſily muſing, and intent upon the main matter. But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>S. Luke writing the hiſtorie, changed not one jot, but writ as Steven ſpoke. Now we need not defend Steven from all errour and fault</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but we muſt quit the Evangeliſt. For onely the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, did never labi memoriâ, or erre in any matter, great or ſmall; other men did.</hi> His proofs are theſe.</p>
               <p>Jephthah in Judges 11.26. pretendeth 300 yeares poſſeſſion, when they were not ſo many: and the divine Pen-man or Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer, writeth as Jephthah pretended; and eſtabliſhed not the truth of the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that Salianus, in his <hi>Annales, Anno Mundi</hi> 2849, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6913:139"/>one account, wherein the time of the Iſraelites coming out of Egypt, to the inſtant of Jephthahs arguing, is 377 yeares: and from the death of Sihon king of the Amorites, 337 yeares. But the truth is, (if we will hit the exact number) both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus and Tremellius, and many others ſay, That from the coming out of Egypt, and from the giving of the Law, unto this preſent controverſie of Jephthah with the King of the Amorites, there were 305, or 306 yeares expired. And Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius well obſerveth, that Jephthah began his narration from their coming forth of Egypt, verſ. 16. Therefore thence beginneth the number, and the reckoning. Now the ſhortning of an account, is an uſuall Ellipſis, both in Scripture, and in other Authours. The 70 Interpreters are cited for 72. Among the Romanes, the <hi>Centum-viri</hi> conſiſted of one hundred and five men. Judges 20.46. <hi>all which fell of Benjamin that day, were</hi> 25000. yet there fell that day 100 more, verſ. 35. So 2. Sam. 5.5. the account is ſhortened by ſix moneths leſſe then was ſet down in the precedent verſe; it being
<note n="b" place="margin">Synecdoche frequent, ad rotunditatem nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</note> 
                  <hi>A frequent Synecdoche, to make a round and ſmooth reckoning,</hi> ſaith Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. If any ſhall yet contend, that Jephthah ſaith expreſly, v. 26. <hi>Iſrael dwelt in Heſhbon and her towns; and in Aroer and her towns; and in all the cities that be along by the coaſts of Arnon,</hi> 300 <hi>yeares;</hi> Peter Martyr on the place anſwereth, That the Scripture-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count often followeth the greater number. Now becauſe the yeares from Sihons death, were nearer 300. then 200. Jephthah reckoneth not the refract, but the whole number; and accounteth them 300 yeares, as inclining to the greater number. For Sihon was overcome, and ſlain the laſt yeare of Moſes his life; <hi>being to the preſent debate,</hi> 266 <hi>yeares,</hi> ſaith Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis; 267, ſaith Lyranus; 270 <hi>yeares,</hi> ſaith Peter Martyr. If Peter Martyrs anſwer be ſleighted, I adde, that the perfection of Scriptures ſtands not ſo ſtrictly on exactneſſe of number, but that it puts a certain number for an uncertain. Inſtances are obvious. So, <hi>while we plead too much for number, we ſhall,</hi> as S. Auguſtine ſaith, <hi>forget, or neglect, both weight and meaſure.</hi> Laſtly, grant that Jephthah either miſtook, or miſpleaded the yeares, in a braving faſhion; and ſay, that the holy Ghoſt hath penned, not what was truth in it ſelf, but what Jephthah al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged erroneouſly, or covetouſly, for his preſcription (for Jephthah had more then one errour:) yet, it followeth not, that S. Steven was deceived; for he was <hi>full of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> when he ſpake this, Act. 7.55. and before he ſpake this, he was <hi>full of faith, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 6.5. <hi>Full of faith and power,</hi> verſ. 8. and they that diſputed with Steven, <hi>were not able to reſiſt the wiſdome and the Spirit, by which he ſpake,</hi> v. 10. Therefore he ſpake wiſely, truely, and by the Spirit, as well as S. Luke wrote by the Spirit; and neither of them could in this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6913:140"/>paſſage erre, though Jephthah be held a man of imperfections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſaith Canus, <hi>the Evangeliſt hath it, Matth.</hi> 2.6. <hi>That</hi> IT IS WRITTEN BY THE PROPHET, AND THOU BETHLEHEM, IN THE LAND OF JUDAH, ART NOT THE LEAST AMONG THE PRINCES OF JUDAH, <hi>when it is not ſo written by the prophet; who ſaith, Micah</hi> 5.2.

                  <hi>I think that S.

Steven did erre, or was miſtaken, or that S. Luke miſreported the words of S. Steven. But enough of this, to teſtifie my diſlike of the ſecond opinion, and of ſuch, who excuſing the Greek Text from corruption, (wherein I wonderfully applaud them) do impute an errour and ſlip unto the holy, powerfull, gracefull, truth-ſpeaking, and dying Protomartyr, S. Steven (which I cannot endure in them.) And certes, both theſe former rejected opinions are built on a falſe ground, and idlely do preſuppoſe, that there is no reall hiſtoricall truth in the words, as they are in the Greek, and in the Latine Text. But truth there is, and though truth lie deep hid, <hi>as in a well</hi> (ſaid he of old;) yet, by Gods help, we ſhall winde her up, and draw her above ground, that every eye may ſee her, though we have many turnings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which that I may the better accompliſh, I muſt ſtraggle awhile after two moſt learned men, Cardinall Cuſanus, and Daniel Heinſius; eſpecially Heinſius; whom when I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and wrung and wonne from him ſome holds, which are offenſive to the majeſtie of ſacred Scripture, then ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and deſcend to the moſt difficult place of Acts 7.16, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The learned worthie Heinſius (whom I name not without honour, though I diſſent from him) in his Exercitations upon Nonnus, and in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> beats out certain paths, which never any on the earth trode upon, before him; pag. 27. making the Helleniſticall language to be the beſt interpreter of the Hebrew and Chaldee; and the Hebrew and Chaldee, interchangeably, the beſt interpreters of it.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:6913:140"/>
               <p>Before all his words or my anſwer be recited, I think fit to premiſe theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, If Heinſius mean onely to extoll the knowledge of the Helleniſticall language, and of the Chaldee and Syriack; I aſſent unto him: nor ſhall any man, in right, aſcribe more to the holy mother of them all, and of all other languages, the primitive Hebrew, the language of God (when he ſpake au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly) and of Angels, unto men, then I will. Yet the pureſt gold may be over-valued, and the very ſhekel of the Sanctuarie thought heavier then it is. And indeed I ſhould be loath to ſay, what the moſt learned Cardinall Cuſanus hath written in his <hi>Compendium, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 240.

                  <hi>It is not abſurd to beleeve, that the firſt art of ſpeaking was ſo copious, and full of many Synonymaes, that all the afterward-divided tongues were in it contained: For all languages are derived from our firſt parent Adams language. And as there is not a tongue which man underſtandeth not; ſo even Adam (who was no other then a man) could underſtand any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage if he heard it: For he was the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>who impoſed names upon the creatures; and therefore no word of any other language was originally inſtituted by any other. Neither are we to wonder at this in Adam, when it is certain, that by the gift of God many have ſuddenly obtained, and ſpeedily were inſpired with the skill and knowledge of all languages.</hi> So farre Cuſanus.</p>
               <p>That there is no language under heaven, but hath ſome words retaining the foot-ſteps of the Hebrew, I beleeve; and in the languages which I underſtand, I can demonſtrate: but that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam could underſtand all languages now ſpoken, if he had heard them, is not credible. When God confounded their language, Geneſ. 11.7. &amp;c. <hi>the language of all the earth,</hi> he did it to this end, that they might not underſtand one anothers ſpeech. The confuſion was not of inventing of new letters, vowels, and conſonants; for they are ſtill the ſame: and if there were ſeventie two languages, as ſay the Ancient, Hierom, Auguſtine, Proſper, Epiphanius; or but fiftie five, (as our Modern writers conjecture) anſwerable to their families, Geneſ. 10. yea two thouſand foure hundred languages more; they might all be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the firſt two and twenty letters: Nor was it onely ſuch a confuſion, as when the ſweet ſinging of the nightingales is undiſtinguiſhable through the obſtreperouſneſſe of gagling geeſe, and chattering daws. For if at the beginning of that confuſion every one had ſpoken to another articulately and diſtinctly, <hi>alternis vicibus;</hi> they could not have underſtood, what either ſaid; though afterward by uſe, each familie under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood themſelves, as we may dumbe men. But the confuſion conſiſted in this, That God took away from all, ſave the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Heber, the habituall, or actuall knowledge of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue; emptying the treaſuries of their memories, both
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6913:141"/>ſenſitive and intellective, from all and every old note, impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, character, figure, or ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when by an univerſall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or oblivion, he had drowned or blotted out all former conceptions; he prompted readily unto them new forms, and furniſhed their intellectualls with new notions; which the pliable obedience of the tongue (at firſt not knowing what it ſaid) uttered in new words and languages; by the tranſpoſition and tranſ-changing, adding or diminiſhing of a letter, or letters. See Avenarius, drawing almoſt all Greek; and our Minſhaw, many languages from the Hebrew. But if they retained the ſame ſyllable, and the ſame word; yet in one language it ſignified one thing, and in another, another thing; as <hi>ſus</hi> ſignifieth, in the Hebrew, an <hi>horſe;</hi> with the Flaunderkins, <hi>ſilence;</hi> among the Latines, an <hi>hogge:</hi> as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius à Lapide hath obſerved. Nor think I, that Noah (who lived at the confuſion of Babel; and was born within ſevenſcore yeares of Adams death) could underſtand all their languages, without much commerce, ſtudie, or divine revelation. Beſides all this, all ages have made and framed new words; nor is any time to be blamed,
<q>
                     <l>— ſi nova rerum</l>
                     <l>Nomina protulerit, — If it coyn new names:</l>
                  </q> it was lawfull, and is yet, — <hi>dabitúrque licentia ſumpta pudenter, It ſhall be lawfull, ſo it be done modeſtly without enforcement,</hi> ſaith Horace, <hi>De arte Poetica.</hi> And though there were but few yeares, about half a mans age, between the firſt and ſecond Punick warre; yet the articles of peace made at the end of the firſt warre, were hardly underſtood at the ſecond, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from Polybius. What ſpeak I of words, when new languages have ſprung up, more then ever were at the confuſion of Babel? If God at the overthrow of Babel coyned or ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Greek; and if Adam could have underſtood it; were all its dialects diſtinguiſhed, or no? and the Helleniſticall Greek, or Grecanick language? (that I may uſe ſome of Heinſius his words.) And if thoſe were then ſpoken, and then intelligible; was the now common corrupt Greek misformed? or could Adam underſtand that, which Plato or Ariſtotle would ſweat to expound? If the Teutonick were then ſpoken; was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon, Engliſh, Scotiſh, &amp;c. (the derivatives from it, as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtegan and others will have it) then in uſe? If the Latine was framed in Babel; was it the firſt old blunt Latine, or the refined? If the refined; was the Valachian, Italian, Spaniſh, French, (the Provinciall tongues of Rome, if I may ſo call them) at that time ſpoken? I could be plentifull herein. But I paſſe unto the objections of Cuſanus, which ſhall receive this ſatisfaction in order.</p>

               <p>Object. 1. <hi>The firſt art of humane ſpeech was copious by many Synonymaes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, The Hebrew had but few Synonymaes, few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Radixes, in compariſon of other languages; many words ſignifying contrary things, every one divers things: nor did Adam ſpeak any but Hebrew, nor needed he know any more. Cicero cried out of old,

               <p>Object. 3. <hi>As there is no language but ſome man underſtandeth, ſo there is no language but Adam, who ſignifieth a man, could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand if he heard.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, They had the gift of all tongues then neceſſarie to be ſpoken or underſtood; perchance of all tongues then in being: that as when people inclined to idolatrie, the diverſitie of tongues was introduced; ſo when they were to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Chriſt, the cloven tongues ſitting on the Apoſtles, might finde a remedie for that diverſitie, by the gift of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.

                  <hi>The Apoſtles were taught from heaven the languages of all nations, ſo farre forth as was requiſite for the doctrine of faith; but for points of elegancie, the Apoſtles were onely skilfull in their own tongue.

               <p>That Adam could have done it by Gods miraculous power, I confeſſe: that he could out-weather any meer man by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gifts, I beleeve: what he could have done by labour or ſtudie in a little time, if he had heard or read any language, I will not queſtion; ſince man hath found out the language of Hieroglyphicks; and the tongue of characters hath been read; and if you place conſtantly ſeverall things in the room of ſeverall letters, a dog for A, a tooth for B, a lion for C, and the like; a little practiſe will diſcover the true meaning. But my controverſie with Cuſanus is, What Adam could do ſuddenly, naturally, and ordinarily, if he heard our mongrell Neoterick languages. He is for the affirmative, That Adam underſtood them, or could underſtand them. I am for the negative.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>The conſideration of which curſe and excommunication, ſtrikes horrour to my ſoul, in compaſſion of thoſe who have raiſed their houſes out of the ruines of things ſacred with ſuch dreadfull imprecations, and feed themſelves fat with revenews properly belonging to the Altar.

               <p>The ſame M.

Theſe things I have related out of that moſt learned Antiquarie, my worthy friend M.

               <p>I muſt return back to <hi>Maran-atha;</hi> whoſe compoſition is thus, as Martyr opineth. The firſt part of it, is the Noun MARA: the ſecond is an affix of the poſſeſsive Pronoun, of the firſt perſon, with the number of multitude, making MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA to be MARAN: the third particle and the cloſe is the Verb ATHA, <hi>venit.</hi> Moreover, concerning the tenſe of the Verb there is queſtion. Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Theophylact reade it <hi>in tempore praeterito,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Our Lord is come;</hi> with whom agree Hierom and Eſtius: others will have it to be the preſent tenſe; ſpeaking as if he did come preſently, becauſe he ſhall come certainly; and becauſe none can ſay, he ſhall not come at this preſent. This tenſe Cornelius à Lapide approveth, on this conſideration, becauſe the Jews condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any were wont to do ſo, under the commination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the inſtant divine judgement, as Pſal. 9.19. <hi>Ariſe, O Lord,—let the heathen be judged in thy ſight:</hi> or rather, ſaith Lapide, it may be in the Optative, MARAN-ATHA, <hi>Veniat Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus:</hi> howſoever he is peremptorie, that it is a cold expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which applieth the words to the Preterperfect tenſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6913:144"/>and the meaning to the firſt coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let me adde, that whether the word be read in the Preſent tenſe in the Indicative, or in the Optative mood, <hi>Venit,</hi> or, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat; He cometh,</hi> or <hi>let him come;</hi> it pointeth not at the paſt, but at the future coming of Chriſt. Yea, Jude 14. (where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed) our Tranſlation hath it, <hi>The Lord cometh;</hi> and the words immediately following, make it to have appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and undeniable reference to the laſt judgement. Nor were the words <hi>Maran-atha</hi> taken from Moſes, Deut. 33.2. though he ſaith, <hi>The Lord came with</hi> 11000 <hi>of Saints:</hi> where is a great ſimilitude of ſome particulars; for there is related what paſſed at the deliverie of the Law; and neither <hi>Mara</hi> nor <hi>Maran</hi> is mentioned; but rather by the ſemblance of words we may think Moſes alluded to the propheſie of Enoch, which long after this S. Jude citeth expreſly, as propheſying of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment to be inflicted for the breach of the Law. And indeed Ambroſe well expounds our <hi>Maran-atha</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt: ſo Clemens Romanus, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>in fine.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 178 thus, <hi>Anathema, condemnatus, Maran-atha, definiunt, Donec Dominus redeat; Condemned till the Lord return to judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt true it is, <hi>Maran-atha</hi> is added, to exaggerate the power of the Execration, and that it is a form of Execration: ſo was it in the intent of the Donor in Mariana. The Talmudiſts ſay, it ſignifieth one delivered into the hand of the Tormentour, by the judgement of the Lord himſelf. Anſwerable it is in ſenſe, to the words in the 17. Chapter of the 6. Councel of Toledo;

               <p>Nor let any object the unlikelihood, that this <hi>Anathema</hi> is taken from Enochs propheſie, becauſe S. Jude hath it not, like <hi>Maran-atha,</hi>

               <p>An other inſtance is in Act. 3.21. What is in the Latine and Greek full of Amphibologie, diverſely, at divers editions, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Beza and others, is plain, &amp; radiant in the Syriack; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:6913:145"/>GOD is meant; both becauſe our bleſſed Saviours laſt words were, Luke 23.46. <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit;</hi> which moſt certainly was received into the hands of his Father in heaven; as alſo, for that not onely the word <hi>Coeli,</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, is taken for God; according to the uſe of the Aramaeans and alſo of the Jews; as appeareth in the record containing the jointure and dowrie which Rabbi Moſes made to Clarora, the daughter of Rabbi David, explained by Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, at the end of his Aramaean and Hebrew Grammar; where the Bridegroom ſaith (among other things)

               <p>Thirdly, if Heinſius had onely ſaid, that S. John ſaw the Helleniſts; that S.

               <p>Fourthly, if Heinſius mean, that the Helleniſts onely, who were not inſpired from God, conceived in one tongue, what they did write; and wrote in another, what they conceived; I will ſubſcribe; and adde, that whatſoever they did ſpeak in Greek, they firſt had the notions of it in Syriack; and thence did, as it were, tranſlate their ſpeech, or writings; even (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) Philo, and Joſephus, and ſuch as trafficked much with Greece, and Greeks: unleſſe among the Jews there might be ſuch a caſe, as was of Lord Michael de Mountaigne, who (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf relateth in his Eſſaies, 1.25.) being born a French man, yet never heard French, till he was above ſix yeares old; nor underſtood any word of his mother-tongue, no more then he did Arabick; becauſe he was brought up, where he heard no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther language ſpoken, then Latine onely: and therefore long after, when he uſually ſpake nothing, but his Perigordin or French; yet upon great ſudden exigents, his conceits were firſt ſhaped in Latine; and his words brake forth, ere he was aware, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and not in French, as himſelf recordeth. So ſay I, if a Jew were thus brought up in the Greek, or in any other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, his conceits might be the apprehenſions of his childiſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and not of that tongue which he uſed after.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, if becauſe Heinſius himſelf is a daintie Critick, he will reduce the judgement of all Divinitie to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; of all Scriptures to Criticiſme; I will not contradict it, if we confine this judiciarie Cenſorſhip and Criticiſme to men skilfull and eminent in all arts, ſciences, and languages: for who can ſo well interpret Scripture, as ſuch men? It was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate conceit of hood winkt men, as is recorded in the hiſtorie of the councel of Trent, lib. 2. pag. 122.

                  <hi>When each man hath power to inguire into the tranſlation of the Scripture whether it be good or no; either comparing it with other interpreters, or conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Hebrew Text: then theſe new-ſprung pettie-Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would make a confuſion of all things, and arrogate to themſelves alone the judgement and reſolutions in matters of faith.</hi> And pag. 125.

                  <hi>This made a powerfull impreſsion upon the mindes of the Prelates: becauſe it was ſaid Grammarians would aſſume to themſelves authoritie to direct and inſtruct Biſhops and Divines.</hi> Wiſely, wiſely; as if Divines and Biſhops ought not to have been perfect Grammarians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were Divines: As if both could not conſiſt together: As if famous and deep Divines had not been admirable, yea,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6913:146"/>the beſt and ſoundeſt of all Linguiſts and Criticks; whom they ſcornfully term pettie Grammarians: As if they envied any men theſe paſſages of learning, which they kenned not; and would put out the candle, which other men lighted; delighting rather in darkneſſe, then ſuffering ſome places, uſed by Popes and School-men, to be queſtioned and cleared: and it was a juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Friars againſt the Fathers, in the councel of Trent, becauſe they were ſo prompt to define Articles, and pronounce Anathemaes, when they did not well underſtand, and were loth to be taught the things themſelves, as it is in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the councel of Trent, lib. 6. pag. 481.</p>

               <p>Profane ones I will not priviledge from miſtaking of God: as perhaps, leſt Satan might out-ſtretch his Commiſsion from God, when he gave Job into his hands, God ſaid reſtraining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Onely ſave his life,</hi> Job 2.6. And S. Auguſtine, <hi>de cura pro mortuis gerenda, cap.</hi> 12. telleth an admirable ſtorie of two men, each called <hi>Curma;</hi> to wit, How Curma the Countrey-man lay almoſt dead many dayes: onely, a little ſteam of breath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from him, they kept him from buriall, though he was without motion, or any feeling, whatſoever they did unto him; in which time he ſaw many viſions: So ſoon as he opened his eyes, he ſaid, <hi>Let one go to the houſe of Curma the ſmith.</hi> Who was found dead that moment in which Curma the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to his ſenſes. And the ſurviving Curma related, that he heard in the place from whence he was returned, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6913:148"/>the ſmith, and not himſelf, was to be brought to that place. A miſtaking there was by the meſſengers of death, though it were after righted. Caiaphas might not know the inſpiration or inſtinct propheticall which he had; becauſe he was a wicked man: <hi>Diſpenſativè illi contigit ſermo, He did diſtribute the ſpeech to others, which he knew not himſelf,</hi> ſaith Baſil <hi>in Prooem. Iſaiae.</hi> He was a Prophet <hi>perchance; Caſu,</hi> ſaith Origen on John. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam his aſſe and Caiaphas ſpake they knew not what. <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was tranſitorie,</hi> ſaith S. Auguſtine. Wherefore I conclude, as before, That wicked men may be puniſhed with miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings in things divine. But that ever any holy man was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the end, that God moved when he moved him; or that the righteous were ever deceived by Oraculous, anfractuous perplexities; or that the Notaries of heaven, the writers of any part authentick of either Teſtament, could be deceived in their conceptions, is not agreeable to likelihood, reaſon, or truth.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>Lemma</hi> is this, The holy Penmen could not erre in writing.</p>
               <p>If they could, what difference is there between their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and other profane Authours?</p>
               <p>And to what end had they infallibilitie of underſtanding, if what they underſtood they could expreſſe erroneouſly?</p>
               <p>A readie, perfect, and quick ſcribe writeth not falſly; but, <hi>My tongue is the pen of a readie writer,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmograph, Pſal. 45.1. Holy Ezra, who was the divine <hi>amanuenſis</hi> of the book of Ezra, is called by the ſame words, SOPHIR MAHIR, <hi>a readie, ſwift, exact ſcribe,</hi> Ezra 7.6. no queſtion, with alluſion to the words of the Pſalmiſt.</p>
               <p>John 16.13. <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> How into all truth, if there be an errour in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Or, had God care that the Apoſtles ſhould not miſſe of the truth in their Speeches, and yet miſſe in their Writings?</p>
               <p>If the Prophets could not erre, no more could the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts or Apoſtles: for, if there were any ſuperioritie in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, we are rather to aſcribe it to theſe latter, then to thoſe former; in regard that the Law of Chriſt and of Grace, is farre above the Law of Moſes, as the Apoſtle doth demonſtrate to the Hebrews themſelves. But that the Prophets could not erre is apparent, becauſe Chriſt himſelf, who is Truth, would not have appealed from the preſent more viſible pretending Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue, to them as all-ſufficient Judges (as he often did) if they could erre. A perfect rule is not to be tried by an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one. Prophets writ their Propheſies, and faſtened them to the gates of the Temple, and other publick places, to be read: and were rather judged by their Propheſies written, then by them as inſpired or uttered by mouth.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Gnomon</hi> of the Sunne-diall, which our late Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Poetaſter doth make to ſignifie the Scriptures, is better to be judged by a moving clock, the curious handie-work of the ſame great Artiſt (I mean, by the Church, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; with whom Chriſt hath promiſed his Spirit ſhall be to the end of the world) then by the rude maſons, or rather the ſenſeleſſe ſtones and mortar of the walls, (I mean the ignorant people) who have plucked down not onely the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock (by his interpretation, the Pope) but uſurp to themſelves a power to judge the <hi>Gnomon;</hi> and to reform and amend the well wrought, well ordered clock. The ſhallow phantaſtick ſtateth not the queſtion aright, when he is ſo magiſterially peremptorie; ſaying, <hi>That the Clergie may not ſo judge of the Scriptures, as to conclude or teach any thing againſt them; or to vouch unwritten verities</hi> (if they be certain verities, it matter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not much whether they be written or unwritten: Veritie will vouch it ſelf in ſpight of lying Poets) <hi>as ſome call them, or Traditions contradictorie to the written Word:</hi> Which contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie Traditions do much differ from unwritten Verities, howſoever the Poet confuſedly joyneth them. For, who of us ever taught that the Clergie may teach any thing againſt the Scriptures? when we profeſſe with him, that the Church ought to ſubject it ſelf to be directed by the Scriptures. But that fabling rymer may ſay any thing, who in his <hi>Sarcaſmos</hi> and Frontiſpice is ſuffered thus to rave,
<q>No wonder that the Clergie would be Kings:</q> whereas we the now unpriviledged Clergie, do humbly pray to God to uphold our declining eſtates from the hands of thoſe Atheiſts, and turbulent Anti-epiſcopall, Anti-monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Reformiſts; perhaps Penſioners of the forcin enemies of our State, who, under the pretence of Religion, labour to pluck down our Church and Eccleſiaſtick Hierarchie; and upon the ruines thereof to ariſe to the depluming of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; to the bearding of the Lion; not onely to the paring of the royall prerogative, but alſo the removing the very ſcepter and crown from the Anointed of the Lord, (whom God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies mightily defend!) and to the bringing in of popular government: for, <hi>No Biſhop, no King,</hi> ſaid the learned, wiſe, and pious King James, moſt truely.</p>
               <p>I return to retort the Church-reforming Poets words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf: In his Solarie he ſaith, That the diall is the Written Word, which is of it ſelf dead and unprofitable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further illumination; ſince none of the Philoſophers, nor Solomon himſelf, by the meer ſtrength of Nature, could from thence draw ſaving knowledge without ſaving grace. The queſtion is not, Whether the Scripture or Church ſhall be Judge; but, Whether the Clergie or Laitie ſhall be Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6913:149"/>of this dead word, and unprofitable without further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. We bid not the people to pluck out their eies, that they may be led by us, as the Jeſuites and Popiſh Prieſts do; neither do we like the other extream of the people, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that they can give better anſwer then the Ephod, the Urim and the Thummim; and over-ſee the Seers, who ought (by the expreſſe commandment of God himſelf) to have the overſight of them, Heb. 13.7. But they are to reſt contented with the generall Commiſſion given to the Miniſterie, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me;</hi> eſpecially in things (as moſt things are) above their capacitie. But the people will expound Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, contradict their Paſtours, cenſure their labours, judge their Judges, even in matters of ſuch ſpeculation as they may moſt ſafely be ignorant of; and, under pretence of deſire to have their conſciences well informed, will not be informed at all in any thing againſt their humours and fancie; but mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize the Spirit to themſelves, and yeeld no more in this point to the ordinance of God, who hath committed to us the word of reconciliation, then to the very devils, whom they are bound to beleeve and follow, in all things wherein their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are well informed.</p>
               <p>My former task recalleth me. Bezaleel and Aholiab both did and could work all manner of work for the ſervice of the Sanctuarie, <hi>according to all that the Lord had commanded,</hi> Exod. 36.1. Had God more care of his Sanctuarie, then of the Church of Chriſt? Or could God command an untruth, when he guided the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts as powerfully, if not more then ever he did the workmen of his Sanctuarie? Or had the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men leſſe grace or goodneſſe then the workmen? Certainly they had, if they ſwarved in writing from what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God. Moſes was admoniſhed of God, when he was about to make the Tabernacle; <hi>See</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that thou makeſt all things according to the pattern ſhewed thee in the mount,</hi> Hebr. 8.5. which the Apoſtle borrowed from Exod. 25.8, &amp;c. where God giveth this charge, <hi>Let them make me a Sanctuarie — according to all that I ſhew thee, after the pattern of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and the pattern of all the inſtruments thereof, even ſo ſhall ye make it.</hi> So, and no otherwiſe; not ſo much as a little nail or peg ſhall make any difference. And ſhall we think, that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles might ſwarve in writing from what was delivered unto them?</p>
               <p>That Chriſt himſelf could and did reade, is proved Luk. 4.16. That he could and did write is plain, John 8.6, &amp;c. That he ever wrote any part of his doctrine, of the Law of Grace, of our Scripture, is not evident: for though Baronius, <hi>ad annum Chriſti</hi> 31. ſaith, That many of the Ancients beleeved that our bleſved Saviour wrote an epiſtle unto Abagarus, or Abgarus,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6913:150"/>Prince of Edeſſa; yet ſince Salianus wholly balketh this ſtorie, (which he would not have done, if there had been either truth or likelihood in the matter; becauſe of the miracles mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Baronius, wrought by the image of our Saviours face, which himſelf ſent to the ſame Prince) let us eſteem it as a thing unworthy of belief. That whatſoever Chriſt did, he did both well and conveniently; and whatſoever he omitted, he alſo omitted well and conveniently, I take for moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: and yet, if he had done ſomething which he omitted, I dare ſay he had alſo done well and conveniently: and I ſhould be afraid to ſay, That it was not convenient for Chriſt to write any part of Scripture therefore, becauſe perſonally he wrote none. <hi>It was convenient for others, and not for Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to write his own doctrine</hi> (ſaith Aquin. 3. <hi>part. quaeſt.</hi> 42. <hi>art.</hi> 4.) <hi>for the excellencie both of the Teacher, and of the doctrine;</hi> which he confirmeth thus, <hi>The moſt excellent way was, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print his doctrine in their hearts: So did Chriſt teach,</hi> As HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VING POWER, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29. <hi>and Pythagoras and Socrates, the excellenteſt teachers among the Gentiles, would write nothing. For the Scripture is ordained to imprint doctrine in the hearts, as to an end. Moreover, if Chriſt had written his own doctrine,
<note n="q" place="margin">Nihil altiùs de ejus doctrina bomines aeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marent, quàm quod Scriptura contineret.</note> men would never have had an higher eſteem of his doctrine, then of that which might ariſe from things contained in Scripture.</hi> Thoſe are the words of Aquin. Much of this is but meer froth, and the ſhadow of reaſon, unfitting the pen of ſo Angelicall a Doctour; who remembred not that God himſelf wrote the Law; and that God did write the Law in ſome mens hearts, as well as in ſtone, Hebr. 8.10. and ſo might Chriſt in both, if he had pleaſed. As for Pythagoras and Socrates, if they wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet their words made no deeper impreſſion upon the hearts of their auditours, then the writings of many other men have done upon the hearts of their readers. Moreover, ſome have thought that Pythagoras and Socrates were not the excellenteſt teachers among the Gentiles; Ariſtotle and Plato are eſteemed their equals; and ſome have preferred Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Triſmegiſtus and Homer before both of them. Indeed the Scripture was ordained to imprint doctrine in the heart; was it therefore inconvenient that Chriſt himſelf ſhould write? His ſpeech was ordained to imprint his doctrine in their hearts, as to an end; yet was not his ſpeech inconvenient: no more inconvenient had been his writing; yea rather more convenient (if ſo it had pleaſed him) becauſe many of his words reached but to a few; but his writings might have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many millions of places and perſons more, and might have been everlaſting. To conclude, If the Jews looked through the vails, types, and ſhadows of Moſes Law, to the more ſpirituall things of Chriſt; then certainly, if Chriſt had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6913:150"/>writ his doctrine, we would not eſteem of him according to the letter onely of that doctrine; but we would think (as we ought) that either he wrote not all, or wrote onely ſuch things as were fit for us to know, or as we could underſtand; reſerving more ſecret, deep, and divine things to himſelf. For reaſons beſt known to himſelf, he baptized not any, no not his own Apoſtles. For reaſons beſt known to himſelf, he wrote not immediately any part of Scripture. To ſay it was not convenient becauſe Chriſt did it not, inferreth that Chriſt was bound to do all things convenient; yea, and which man judgeth convenient; and what he did not do was not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>God might have bettered, and may yet better ſome of his own works, though they be very good: Shall we conclude, that becauſe he did not, therefore it was not fit he ſhould have done ſo? God did not ſay at the end of the ſecond dayes work particularly and expreſſely, <hi>It was good,</hi> or <hi>God ſaw that it was good;</hi> as he did at all and every of the other five dayes creation: Was it therefore not good? Yes verily; for Gen. 1.31. <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, it was very good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>John 14.16, &amp;c. <hi>The Comforter ſhall abide with you for ever: even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him: for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> And verſe 26. <hi>The Comforter ſhall teach you all things:</hi> Therefore he ſhall teach them to write truely: the Spirit of truth will not ſuffer them to write falſly whileſt he dwelleth with them, and in them; as he did when they wrote.</p>
               <p>Inſpiration was ordained as a cauſe, and as a means of right conceiving: conceiving or apprehenſion was appointed as a cauſe and a means of right expreſſion: expreſsion was either by word or writing. Many words were prophetically and moſt divinely ſpoken, which were not written; not ſo many were written, as were firſt ſpoken: The vocall expreſsion was more tranſient and tranſitorie; perhaps, concerning ſome few, and thoſe onely of thoſe times: the expreſsion perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and by writing, was and is directorie to mankinde to the end of the world. Inſpiration, apprehenſion, and much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion by voice, were all as means to this main end, that there might be a Scripture. Shall the means be certain, uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and inerrable; and ſhall the end be dubious, crooked and erring? The perfect uſe of the right means leads on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to an undeceiving and exact end: If the Divine Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could not erre or be miſled in the former, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>imes vaniſhed, leaving no footſteps behinde them; it is not poſsible that they ſhould erre in writing, which is the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6913:151"/>of that divine work, laſting for ever; the abſolute ſquare, and judge, and canon of all mens thoughts, words, and deeds; unleſſe you ſay, God had leſſe care to preſerve from corruption divine records filed up on eviternitie, and neceſſarie at all times, for all perſons, in all places (as the Scriptures now are) then he had of inſpirations: which ended onely in the apprehenſion, if they were not expreſſed; or turned into aire, and vaniſhed almoſt with the breath, if they were onely ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Nor let any man ſay that writing is further removed from the divine operation, then inſpiration was, and ſo more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour: for it ſhall appeare ere long, that the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which began by inſpiration, ſat, ſtill moving on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not leaving his own work till there was a perfect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, till the end was accompliſhed, and the will of God was written in words and letters of truth; ſo that not one Iota or tittle had any errour. Yea, let me go one ſtep further, and ſay, that when the Apoſtles did dictate to their ſcribes, actuaries, or ſecretaries, not onely not themſelves, but not their notaries could erre.</p>
               <p>And yet I have read of two mad ſtories croſſe to my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: the one in Sixtus Senenſis, <hi>Bibliothecae ſanctae,</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 120. on the name <hi>Tertius:</hi> who recordeth out of Diodorus Biſhop of Tarſus, that this Tertius, being no excellent ſpeaker nor writer, made the obſcure Epiſtle of S. Paul to the Romanes to be more obſcure, whileſt he laboured to expreſſe S. Pauls thoughts and ſenſe, by more confuſed and unabſolute ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and tranſpoſed explications. As if S. Paul could not write ſufficiently himſelf: though he ſaid (in humbleneſſe) <hi>Rudis ſermone ſum, I am rude in ſpeech,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.6. yet was he <hi>powerfull in writing,</hi> 2. Cor. 10.10: As if he had not divers moſt ſufficient ſcribes by him: As if he would permit the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſo divine, ſuper-divine an Epiſtle to an Ignaro, a ſilly fellow: As if Tertius himſelf wrote not this Epiſtle <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>by divine authoritie,</hi> or (as Cajetan thinketh) theſe words, <hi>In the Lord,</hi> are added to ſhew that he did not write it as an hireling: which ſenſe is made good by ſome authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to the diverſitie of punctation: As if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who inſpired Paul dictating, ruled not the hand of Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us writing: As if S. Paul would make ſo block-headed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple as Tertius is feigned to be, to be his ſcribe, and that in his moſt majeſticall and obſcureſt Epiſtle: Or if Tertius were ſo, that he ſhould be thought worthy to be <hi>Iconii Epiſcopus,</hi> and have that extraordinarie grace to be crowned with Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; as Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie recordeth of him: As if S. Peter (whom Paul <hi>withſtood</hi> for a ſmaller matter <hi>to the face,</hi> Gal. 2.11.) when he ſaid that there were in all S. Pauls Epiſtles
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6913:151"/>ſome things hard to be underſtood, would have commended his fellow-Apoſtles wiſdome, as he did, 2. Pet. 3.15. and not rather have found fault with his follie, and the manner of his writing, if not with the matter alſo, if Tertius had been ſo abſurd as Diodorus imagined; eſpecially ſeeing S. Peter ſaith, that the unlearned and unſtable wreſt ſome of thoſe writings unto their own deſtruction: which in all likelihood ſhould juſtly rather ſwallow up S. Paul for his careleſneſſe of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Tertius for his ſupineneſſe, or rather blaſphemous forgerie of divine truths by miſ-writing them, if any fault could have been truely imputed to either of them. But of this we ſhall ſpeak (by Gods help) more at large in the next ſection ſave one.</p>
               <p>The ſecond mad ſtorie followeth. Becauſe ſome were wont to forge Epiſtles in S. Pauls name, (as is apparent 2. Theſſ. 2.2. where he beſeecheth them, <hi>Not to be ſhaken in minde, or to be troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us)</hi> therefore he alway ſubſcribed his own name to all his Epiſtles,
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bicunque ſciebat falſos adeſſe doctores.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereſoever he knew that there were falſe teachers,</hi> ſaith Hierom on Gal. 6.11. On which place he alſo relateth, that a very learned man of thoſe times ſaid, S. Paul being an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew knew not Greek letters: and becauſe neceſsitie required that he ſhould ſubſcribe with his own hand to the Epiſtle,
<note n="t" place="margin">Contra conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem curvos tramites literarum vix magnis apicibus exprimebat.</note> 
                  <hi>He wrote, though in ill-ſhaped, unhandſome, very great letters:</hi> ſhewing this teſtimonie of a kinde affection, that he would endeavour to do for the Galatians what indeed he could not do. Whereby he concludeth, that S. Paul could not write Greek, at leaſt, not in a legible good hand. S. Hierom won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the ridiculouſneſſe of his expoſition (as well he might) becauſe the Apoſtle uſed to ſubſcribe to divers of his Epiſtles, and here he wrote this whole Epiſtle with his own hand: and yet S. Hieroms expoſition is almoſt as forced as the former:
<note n="u" place="margin">Grandibus Paulus literis ſcripſit, quia ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus erat grandis in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris, &amp; Spiritu Dei vivi, non atrameuto &amp; calamo fuerat exaratus.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Paul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wrote in large long cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or letters, becauſe the ſenſe was great in the words, and was written by the Spirit of the living God, and not with penne and ink.</hi> For though the ſenſe and words of this Epiſtle to the Galatians be from God, and moſt divine; yet there is no reaſon to imagine, that S. Paul intended to include that ſenſe under theſe words, <hi>Videte,</hi> or <hi>Videtis qualibus literis ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſi vobis manu meâ You ſee how large a letter I have written to you with mine own hand.</hi> But if the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth ſignifie quantitie; though S. Paul wrote in great letters and characters, yet it might be a verie good and fair hand: as there are few fairer writings then ſome where the letters are large and full drawn: and I doubt not but he who gave them the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gift of tongues and languages did alſo, as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie appendant, give them the power to write well thoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;

We never reade that the holy Apoſtles, Peter, James, or John, were learned; or could reade or write before their calling; or learned it by degrees after their Apoſtleſhip: yet they could and did write; and as the Spirit guided their thoughts and words, ſo did he their hands; and they wrote both divinely for matter, and (as I think) exquiſitely for the manner; yea, more exquiſitely then other men, as being governed and actuated by the hand of God, which is perfect in all his works. And indeed the true ſenſe of the place (in my opinion) toucheth not at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formedneſſe of the characters, or at the grand-greatneſſe of them; but at the length or prolixitie of the Epiſtle: which is excellently rendered by our Engliſh, <hi>You ſee how large a letter I have written;</hi> as if S. Paul had ſpoke thus, more at large; <hi>I who before told you that we muſt not be weary of well-doing, but muſt do good unto all men whileſt we have time, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith; I ſay, I my ſelf have not been wearie in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Epiſtle, though it be long: and whileſt I had time, I have ſpent that time in doing you good, by writing this letter, by writing this long and large letter to you. For though I have written longer Epiſtles, yet I did rather ſubſcribe to them, and wrote not all of any one of them with mine own hand; but you may take it as a token of my heartie love, that I wrote all this Epiſtle my ſelf: You ſee how large a letter I have writ to you with mine own hand.</hi> And this ſenſe better anſwereth to the coherence, then that of S. Hierom, or of the other learned man whom S. Hierom wondered at. So much for the third <hi>Lemma.</hi>

               <p>Yea, God did uſe other means in the law of nature; for above 2450 yeares the Patriarchs were nouriſhed with agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall Tradition onely.

Thus the concluſion being firm, That <hi>the word of God was written caſually,</hi> that is, <hi>the ſacred Pen-men were inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to write all of it upon juſt motives, and fair occurrences;</hi> and yet <hi>not caſually,</hi> if we take the word, <hi>in ſenſu profano, &amp; uſu forenſi:</hi> I proceed to the third Queſtion, Whether they were commanded to write?</p>
               <p>They who reade the Scripture, may think this queſtion idle and impertinent: but who hath been converſant in the thornie paths of controverſies, ſhall finde much oppoſition by our adverſaries. Bellarmine, <hi>de Verbo Dei non ſcripto,</hi> 4.3. ſaith thus,

                  <hi>Whatſoever Chriſt would have us reade of his words and works, that did he command the Evangeliſts, as if they had been his own hands, to write.</hi> Bellarmine anſwereth:
<note n="d" place="margin">Lequitur de imperio interno, quod ſuggeſtio quaedam &amp; inſpiratio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs quàm praeceptum propriè dictum exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari debet.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſpeaketh of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward command, which is rather a ſuggeſtion and inſpiration then a proper command.</hi> I reply; Of precepts properly ſo called, ſome are hid and ſecret, others more manifeſt: the internall command bindes as much as the externall; divine ſuggeſtions oft times have the force of an expreſſe inward precept; and commands are ſometimes manifeſted by inſpirations. <hi>Praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum propriè dictum,</hi> which is by word or writing, and <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium internum,</hi> may be equivalent; and ſo long as it is <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um internum,</hi> what need we care though it be not <hi>Praeceptum propriè dictum?</hi> And the command was to write, which is an outward act.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection brought by Bellarmine againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is from the Revelation, where S. John is commanded divers times <hi>to write.</hi> To this he anſwereth moſt unclerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, That <hi>S. John was commanded to write certain hidden vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; not the doctrine of the Goſpel, and precepts of manners.</hi> But this is eaſily confuted: for Revel. 19.9. it is ſaid, <hi>Write, Bleſſed are they which are called to the marriage-ſupper of the Lambe.</hi> Is not this the doctrine of the Goſpel? what is more Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall? He might have conſidered the marriage-feaſts in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6913:155"/>Goſpels, Matth. 22.2, &amp;c. and Luk. 14.16. And a voice from heaven ſaid, Revel. 14.13. <hi>Write, Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi> Are theſe hidden viſions? Is not this the doctrine of the Goſpel? The like might be amplified out of the firſt, ſecond, and third chapters of the Revelation, where matters of moralitie and precepts of manners are commanded to be written, and are written: and not hidden viſions, but rather the doctrine of repentance, and of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles, Act. 1.8. <hi>Ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me.</hi> He forbeareth the word of <hi>preaching;</hi> and uſeth more generall words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Ye ſhall be witneſſes;</hi> and they bare witneſſe by writing: Joh. 21.24. <hi>This is the diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things; and we know that his teſtimonie is true;</hi> not onely he himſelf, but Peter and the reſt, WE <hi>know that his teſtimonie is true:</hi> what teſtimonie but his writings?
<note n="d" place="margin">Toti operi ſuo fidem vult conciliare.</note> 
                  <hi>He would have all his works or writings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,</hi> ſaith Luc. Brugenſis, and Maldonate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the ſeven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write,</hi> ſaith S. John, <hi>and a voice from heaven ſaith, Write them not,</hi> Revel. 10.4. The Apoſtles forwardneſſe or prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to write, argueth not neceſſarily that he was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded firſt to write; but rather preſuppoſeth it: and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inhibition, <hi>Write not,</hi> may ſerve as an exception to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer generall command that he might have to write.</p>
               <p>Indeed there is no expreſſe record that all and every of the Apoſtles were enjoyned to write: nor is it likely they were; for then they would have obeyed; whereas not the one half of the Apoſtles committed any thing to pen, ink, and paper, for ought we know; But we are ſure that ſome writers of the Old Teſtament were commanded to write: Exod. 17.14. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Write this for a memoriall in a book;</hi> Jerem. 36.2. <hi>Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have ſpoken unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> and S. John was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded eleven or twelve times to write: and thence it is more then probable, that the reſt of the Apoſtles which wrote were commanded to write; they might be expreſſely appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write, though in their writings ſo much be not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. To ſay as Bellarmine doth, <hi>It is falſe that God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtles to write, becauſe ſo much is not written,</hi> is raſh and ill-adviſed; inferring, that they were commanded nothing, except thoſe things which are written. Is every thing falſe that cannot be proved? is nothing true but what can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? To evince a thing to be falſe, is required a reall proof of truth poſitive, which Bellarmine wanteth: and the falſitie may juſtly be retorted home to the Cardinall himſelf, from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6913:156"/>the authoritie of a prime man of his own part. Wiſer A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas 3. <hi>part. quaeſt.</hi> 42. <hi>artic.</hi> 4. &amp; 2. thus, <hi>When the diſciples of Chriſt had written what he ſhewed and ſpake unto them, we muſt in no wiſe ſay that Chriſt himſelf did not write, ſince his members wrote that which they knew by the dictate of him their Head. For whatſoever he would have us reade of his deeds and words, he commanded them as his own hands to write.</hi> Now let Bellarmine ſay, <hi>It is falſe, that the Apoſtles were commanded by God to write.</hi> And thus much ſhall ſerve for the third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>The fourth queſtion. Whether the Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles were compelled to write?</p>
               <p>As when it is ſaid, Luke 1.70. GOD SPAKE BY THE MOUTH OF HIS HOLY PROPHETS, <hi>per</hi> LOQUENDI <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum,</hi> SCRIPTIONEM <hi>quoque comprehendit:</hi> ſo what I propound of Propheticall, Evangelicall, and Apoſtolicall <hi>writing,</hi> muſt alſo be underſtood of their <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> or <hi>dictating;</hi> Whether they were compelled to it?</p>
               <p>Compulſion is of two ſorts; <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>abſolute, Improper</hi> or <hi>mixt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proper,</hi> when a man is forced (as we ſay) in ſpight of his teeth, againſt his will; as ſome who have been drawn to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Thus were they not compelled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mixt,</hi> when a man doth that which he would not do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he feared a greater loſſe; as when a Merchant or Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner caſt their goods into the ſea to ſave their lives; which hath in it part of the voluntarie, and part of the involuntarie: And of this there may be ſome queſtion; for <hi>Jonah fled from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> Jon. 1.3. that is, was unwilling to do the meſſage. Moſes again and again refuſed to be Gods em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to Pharaoh, Exod. 3.11. and to the Iſraelites, Exod. 4.1, 10, 13. Iſaiah was alſo backward, Iſa. 6.5. One anſwer ſerves for all: They were at firſt <hi>fearfull</hi> rather then <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> but when they were confirmed, they readily and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did their duties. So farre were they from ſhadow of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, that they offered their ſervice. When the voice of the Lord ſaid, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> and, <hi>Who will go for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s?</hi> (Iſa. 6.8.) the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi>
               </p>

I anſwer, The word rather excludeth voluntarie and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie will-worſhip, or ſelf-will-ſervice; then includeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: for all this was performed <hi>Libero motu voluntatis, With the free motion of their will:</hi> or (as others take it) <hi>Salvo pleno uſu liberi arbitrii, Without any impeachment of the freedome of their will.

               <p>It may be further objected: Act. 4.20. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard.</hi> Fond is the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinary gloſſe, <hi>We</hi> CANNOT, <hi>that is, We</hi> WILL NOT. By ſuch a <hi>That is</hi> I will confound heaven with earth. But I anſwer, The words imply no violence; the wills of the Apoſtles were not inforced: if the will of man could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, it were no longer <hi>Voluntas, A will,</hi> but rather <hi>Noluntas, No will.</hi> A thing may be ſaid <hi>Poſſe, aut non poſſe fieri, To be, or not to be made;</hi> theſe wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak,</hi> that is, <hi>Non poſſumus convenienter tacere, It is unreaſonable that we ſhould be ſilent. Can the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Bridechamber mourn?</hi> (Matth. 9.15.) is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion without queſtion; for certainly they could: but while the bridegroom was with them, <hi>they could not mourn;</hi> that is, <hi>It was no fit time for them to mourn.</hi> Likewiſe, the Apoſtles could hold their peace; but then it became them not: and therefore they ſay, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Non poſſumus licité, We cannot lawfully:</hi> ſo Lyra expounds the words. <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, 2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak,</hi> that is, <hi>We are very prone and apt to ſpeak.</hi> Mat. 12.34. <hi>How can ye, being evil, ſpeak good things?</hi> and how could the Apoſtles, being good, but ſpeak good things? their ſouls were filled with grace, which boiled forth into words; their mouth could not chooſe but ſpeak what their heart thought: <hi>My heart was hot within me, while I was muſing the fire burned; then ſpake I with my tongue,</hi> Pſal. 39.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak;</hi> that is, <hi>We ſpeak not of our ſelves, but as God teacheth us:</hi>

                  </q> He moveth us, <hi>&amp; mota faciliùs commoventur, Things fixt are not ſo ſoon moved as things in motion:</hi> ſo the Apoſtles were ſilent before; but when the Spirit enlightned their underſtanding and framed their words, could they hold their tongues? them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves anſwer, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſumme it up all thus: It was inconvenient not to ſpeak;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6913:157"/>It was ſinfull not to ſpeak; It proceeded from the habits of grace and goodneſſe that they were ſo prone to ſpeak; It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the celeſtiall ſuggeſtion, actuating their hearts and tongues: Therefore (ſay they) <hi>VVe cannot but ſpeak:</hi> And yet away with all coaction.</p>
               <p>Others may yet alledge the 1. Cor. 9.16. <hi>Neceſsitie is laid upon me to preach the Goſpel;</hi> and verſe 17. <hi>If I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if againſt my will, a diſpenſation is committed unto me.</hi> Unto the firſt part I anſwer, The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie is not of preſſure, angariation, or force; but of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: <hi>Obſtrictus ſum ad hoc, I am commanded and bound to this,</hi> as it is in the tranſlated Arabick: for he was often command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach: In Damaſcus, Act. 22.15. in the temple of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Act. 22.21. at Antioch, Act. 13.2.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rget nos, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgeth us,</hi> ſaith the Vulgat; <hi>Cohibet nos, Reſtraineth us,</hi> ſaith Montanus; <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net nos, Containeth us,</hi> ſaith Oecumenius; <hi>Incendit nos amore, Setteth us on fire with love,</hi> ſaith Theodoret; <hi>Charitas Chriſti con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringit nos in hac ſententia, The love of Chriſt bindes us faſt in this opinion,</hi> ſaith Arabs: ſuch a conſtraint as would not be free; ſuch a bond or knot as would not be untied; ſuch a conſtraint as when a man is commanded to do that which he would do
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6913:157"/>without command; when precept is joyned to voluntarineſſe; when injunction is interpoſed between both precedent and ſubſequent willingneſſe. So much for the Objections.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, for the truth theſe arguments ſtand forth.</p>
               <p>Luke 1.3. <hi>It ſeemed good unto me to write unto thee,</hi> ſaith he. This proveth that the Evangeliſt was not compelled.</p>
               <p>Gal. 6.11. <hi>Ye ſee how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand;</hi> by which words S. Paul ſeeketh to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelf with them for that labour. But it was neither matter of kindeneſſe on his part, nor thank-worthy on their part, if he were compelled.</p>
               <p>No man dares write in a Princes name, without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: S. John was ſpoke to, adviſed, commanded twelve times to write: that he was compelled I reade not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of Johns Epiſtle verſ. 12. the Apoſtle had <hi>many things to write;</hi> yet <hi>would not write with paper and ink,</hi> or <hi>with ink and pen,</hi> as he phraſeth it, Epiſt. 3. verſ. 13. If he <hi>would not,</hi> how was he conſtrained?</p>
               <p>S. Jude <hi>gave all diligence to write,</hi> verſ. 3. ſo farre was he from coaction; And <hi>it was needfull for me to write,</hi> ſaith he in the ſame place: It was not abſolutely neceſſarie; he ſaith not that he was compelled.</p>
               <p>Divers followers of Solomon wrote his Proverbs; who coacted them?</p>
               <p>S. Paul <hi>wrote according to the wiſdome given unto him,</hi> 2. Pet. 3.15. Was this a power compulſive?</p>
               <p>In the Epiſtle to Philemon, verſ. 21. <hi>Having confidence in thy obedience, I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt alſo do more then I ſay:</hi> which words imply, he would not have writ if he had thought Philemon would have been obſtinate, or refractarie, and would have done nothing at his requeſt: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, he was free from coaction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tim. 1.5. The remembrance of the unfeigned faith in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie, in Lois, and Eunice, was the reaſon of S. Pauls writing unto him. Doth reaſon uſe violence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By Silvanus I wrote briefly, exhorting you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Pet. 5.12. Was he compelled himſelf, who exhorted others?</p>

                  <hi>Who religiouſly and gravely contend</hi> (as himſelf ſpeaketh) <hi>that Abraham lied not.</hi> I anſwer more particularly, The plurall might be uſed for the ſingular; or he might think reſervedly, If God will, If we both live. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe wayes is better then that of Canus. But the truth is, The father of the faithfull knew, that though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did kill Iſaac, yet God who <hi>is able to ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham,</hi> Matth. 3.9. <hi>was able to raiſe up Iſaac even from the dead,</hi> Heb. 11.19. and in hope or full aſſurance thereof might ſay, <hi>I and the lad will return;</hi> and yet intend faithfully to ſacrifice his ſonne.

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:6913:160"/>
               <p>I anſwer to each of theſe Apoſtles in particular: and firſt to S. Peter, who ſeemeth to be in doubt and uncertainty what was to be thought concerning Silvanus.</p>
               <p>Divers ſay, he ſpeaketh modeſtly of him, as the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men were wont to do of themſelves. S. Auguſtine, <hi>Tract.</hi> 37. <hi>in Joan.</hi> averreth, that under thoſe words is couched an aſſeveration: As if one ſhould ſay to a ſtubborn ſervant, <hi>Thou doſt contemn me: Conſider; I ſuppoſe I am thy maſter:</hi> where the ſeeming ſuppoſall makes him neither to be, nor ſeem to be ever a whit the leſſe his maſter. But I anſwer, That the holy Ghoſt having not revealed unto S. Peter fully what the heart of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus was, or was like to be, left him to ſuppoſe; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſuppoſall of his ſoul, did dictate unto S. Peter (what the bleſſed Spirit knew better then S. Peter) theſe words. The ſuppoſall of the Apoſtle inferreth not a ſuppoſall of the Spirit; The Spirit was moſt certain when the Apoſtle might be dubious: The holy Ghoſt ſpake (if I may ſo ſay) repreſenting Peter, and in Peters perſon; which might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a ſuppoſall, and yet divinely inſpired to know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he wrote, namely to know this, that he did ſuppoſe. And that upon good motives.</p>
               <p>Whereas S. Paul ſaith, 2. Cor. 11.5. <hi>I ſuppoſe I was not a whit behinde the very chiefeſt Apoſtles:</hi> and 1. Cor. 7.40. <hi>I think I have the Spirit of God;</hi> he ſpeaketh not ſo much <hi>doubtingly</hi> as <hi>humbly.</hi> To uſe diminuent and ſparing phraſes concerning ones ſelf is lawfull: 2. Cor. 11.23. <hi>I ſpeak as a fool,</hi> ſaith S. Paul; yet there was as great a diſſimilitude between a fool and him, as between any (I think) then breathing. Epheſ. 3.8. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me who am leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of Chriſt.</hi> No man had the like priviledge in every degree, as he had in this. S. Peter was <hi>Doctor Judaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, the Doctour of the Jews;</hi> S. Paul <hi>Doctor Gentium, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Gentiles:</hi> yet no man can ſpeak more modeſtly then S. Paul doth of himſelf: <hi>Leſſe then the leaſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> had been much; but <hi>leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> is the depth, the heart, the ſoul of humilitie: which yet is further evidenced, in that he ſaith not, this grace was given when he was a perſecuter, and ſo indeed worſe then any Saint, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt worſe then any man; but to me even now when I am called, now when I am turned; to me now <hi>leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given. Leſſe then the leaſt</hi> is contrary to the rules of Grammar, which admit not a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above a ſuperlative; contrary to common ſenſe; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the literall truth of the things themſelves: for he was <hi>a choſen veſſell, a chief Apoſtle;</hi> few (if any) more chief: <hi>though he ſhould boaſt more of his authoritie, he ſhould not be aſhamed,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:6913:160"/>2. Cor. 10.8. <hi>No whit inferiour</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to the very chiefeſt Apoſtles,</hi> 2. Cor. 12.11. <hi>A Miniſter of Chriſt more then others,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.23: Now though S. Paul uſed <hi>terminis dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuentibus,</hi> and ſpake ſparingly and modeſtly in ſome places concerning himſelf; yet otherwhere he revealeth the whole truth; he knew the certaintie of things, to wit, that he was not leſſe then the leaſt, that he was not as a fool: and when he ſaid, <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> or <hi>I think,</hi> he did <hi>know. Dum minus dicit, majus innuit: Whileſt he ſpeaketh the leſſe, he intimateth the more:</hi> he was never a trumpeter of his own worth, but when he was urged unto it by oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Concerning the place of S. John thus I anſwer: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was governed by the holy Ghoſt, to uſe an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the Orientall Idiotiſme; and perchance aimed at the words, Gen. 13.6. <hi>The land was not able to bear Abraham and Lot, that they might dwell together:</hi> Or at the place of Amos 7.10. <hi>The land is not able to bear all his words;</hi> as is well obſerved by the curious Heinſius. He alſo here is guided by the ſame Spirit, to write, <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> or <hi>I think, that even the world could not contain the books:</hi> as for other reaſons to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, ſo perhaps becauſe both the Spirit would qualifie the <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> and ſpeak within truth which is allowed, rather then beyond truth which is diſallowable: <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> rather then <hi>I know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer more punctually; If the holy Spirit did leave S. Paul neſcient, whether he were rapt in bodie, yea or no; and Paul did know his own neſciencie, 2. Cor. 12.2. why might not the ſame Spirit leave S. Paul, S. Peter, S. John in ſuppoſals? and yet no inconvenience ariſeth thencefrom, ſince they perfectly knew that they did ſuppoſe. <hi>This is the diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things; and we know that his teſtimonie is true,</hi> John 21.24. as S. John ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point; No man ever ſaid, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the holy Penmen mentioned or treated of, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood perfectly, inveſted with all their circumſtances: for they ſpake and writ of the day of judgement, and other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret viſions, whoſe depths were never ſounded by meer man; but ſealed and reſerved, perchance from Angels, till the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall judgement: yet whatſoever matter, ſentences, and words they wrote, they knew as they were writers thereof, and were in no doubt of them, nor could they miſtake them. As they were not omniſcient on the one ſide; ſo were they not ignorant on the other ſide: but whatſoever they ſpake or wrote they knew, and knew much more then ever they ſpake or wrote.</p>
               <p>The ſixth queſtion followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did reade profane authours?</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:6913:161"/>
               <p>Upon the premiſall of ſix points, the anſwer will be moſt expedite.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>That diverſe Prophets and Penmen of the Old Teſtament, were Noble-men, Rulers, or Kings, cannot be denied by him, who thinketh of Iſaiahs birth of royall linage,</hi> ſaith Hierom in the Prologue on him; and Lyranus from the Rabbins; or on David, Solomon, and others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That diverſe alſo were learned before their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to publick place, is moſt apparent. Thus Moſes <hi>was learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the wiſdome of the Egyptians, and was mightie in words and deeds,</hi> Act. 7.22. and this before he was called to his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charge. Thus was Job skilled in Aſtronomie, as his words declare; and Solomon the beſt Philoſopher (as I think) that ever was, except Chriſt and Adam; though Solomons great learning was rather infuſed then acquired.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>puncto</hi> is, That no Penmen of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were Noble: And perchance even therefore our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour would write nothing by himſelf in perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of the bloud-royall. S. Hierom in his Epiſtle to Principia the Virgin, ſaith, <hi>S. John was Noble, and for his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie known to the high Prieſt.</hi> I anſwer, that he was very neare of kindred to our Bleſſed Saviour, and therefore Noble; but that ever he was nobly bred or brought up according to the uſance of the world, or that he was by his nobilitie made known to the high Prieſt, I ſee not proved. S. Paul ſaith, 1. Cor. 1.26. <hi>Ye ſee your calling, brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mightie, not many noble are called:</hi> and verſ. 28. <hi>God hath choſen the baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed.</hi> If any one object, Though there were not many noble called, yet S. John might be one: Eſtius is peremptorie, that
<note n="b" place="margin">Inter duodecim Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti Apoſtolos nullus erat ſecundum ſeculum ſapiens, potens, nobilis.</note> 
                  <hi>Not one of the twelve Apoſtles, according to the world, was wiſe, powerfull, or noble.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>in Luc. ad illud Capitis ſexti,</hi> 13. ELEGIT EX IPSIS, thus,
<note n="c" place="margin">Adverte coeleſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilium: non ſapientes aliquos, non divites, non nobiles, ſed piſcatores &amp; Publicanos, quos diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geret, elegit; nè tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiſſe prudentiâ, nè po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiſſe divitiis, nè po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae nobilitatiſque authoritate traxiſſe ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quos ad ſuam gratiam videretur.</note> 
                  <hi>Obſerve the providence of God: He choſe not any wiſe, nor rich, nor noble, but he elected fiſhers and Publicanes: and them he inſtructed, leſt he might ſeem to have drawn men unto him by worldly wiſdome, or to have redeemed them by wealth, or to have allured them to his ſide and to the participation of his grace, by the reconciling au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of power and nobilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 1. Cor. 4.11. the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the perſon of all his fellows, thus, <hi>Even to this preſent houre we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffetted, and have no certain dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place; and labour, working with our own hands, &amp;c.</hi> which things the Noble of this world will neither do nor ſuffer: Therefore they were not Noble.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing premiſable is this, <hi>None of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were learned before their calling.</hi> S. Paul indeed was <hi>brought
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6913:161"/>up at the feet of Gamaliel,</hi> Act. 22.3. and S. Luke, as being a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, might be learned ere he was a Chriſtian: the like might be ſurmiſed of S. Mark; and the rather, becauſe we reade not that the gift of tongues was given to theſe two. Concerning S. Matthew, though there may be ſome probabilitie that he was learned before his vocation, becauſe he ſat at the receit of cuſtome, Matth. 9.9. for few unlearned men were gatherers of Ceſars cuſtomes or tributes: and though Publicanes were vilely eſteemed of among the Jews, yet divers paſſages of Cicero do ſhew, that they were of good account among the Romanes: and though more particularly it is obſerved, Luk. 5.29. that <hi>Levi</hi> (or <hi>Matthew) made Chriſt a great feaſt in his own houſe; and there was a great companie of Publicanes and of others that ſat down with them;</hi> whence may be inferred, that S. Matthew was a rich man; yet notwithſtanding all this, he might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; and a poore man might make a great feaſt for joy of his extraordinarie calling. See what the young, perhaps, poore plough-man Eliſha did, 1. King. 19.21.</p>
               <p>Joh. 7.15. the Jews ſay of Chriſt, <hi>How knoweth this man let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having never learned?</hi> The Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees knew Chriſt frequented not their ſchools, no not thoſe at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem (for Franciſcus Lucas Brugenſis calleth them <hi>Schools)</hi> pointed at, Luk. 2.46. which were in the Temple, and at the outwardeſt Eaſtern gate of it; I ſay, Chriſt frequented them not to learn; but he at twelve yeares of age went and heard the Doctours, and asked them queſtions; and belike, when they could not anſwer, he did; or els, perhaps, he did anſwer to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtions propounded by them: for <hi>all that heard, him</hi> (even they with whom he diſputed) <hi>were aſtoniſhed at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and anſwers,</hi> Luk. 2.47. John 7.27. <hi>VVe know this man whence he is,</hi> ſay the Jews. As if one be eminent among us, we uſually enquire of his parents, of his breeding, and whole courſe of life: ſo in likelihood they did of Chriſt: They knew his breeding in the citie of Nazareth; <hi>VVhere from his childhood he uſed a mechanicall trade with his ſuppoſed father,</hi> ſaith Pererius: They ſaw him not poring on books, nor tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them over, nor for ſtudies ſake reſorting to any places where religion was taught; yet they heard him, <hi>Legis teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia proferentem, Alledge the words of the Law. They did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his doctrine</hi> (ſay Chryſoſtom, Euthymius, and Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact) <hi>nor beleeved they it; but they were aſtoniſhed at his eloquence and learning, acknowledging them rather inſpired then acquired. From whence hath this man theſe things? and what wiſdome is this which is given unto him?</hi> ſay they, Mark 6.2. As Chriſt never went to any Schools, no more (in all likelihood) did any of his twelve Apoſtles; who being poore tradeſmen, may well be thought unlettered: Matth. 4.21. even <hi>John, and his brother
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6913:162"/>James, with their father Zebedee, were mending their nets;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their povertie and mean calling was deſcribed. Their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is taxed by the Jews, John 7.49. <hi>This people, who knoweth not the Law, are curſed:</hi> where his diſciples are held as illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ignorants. And for this cauſe, I think, Chriſt choſe not either Nicodemus, or Joſeph of Arimathea, or the Lawyer which offered to follow him, or Scribe, Prieſt, or Phariſee, to be any one of his Apoſtles; that Apoſtolicall learning might be rather Divine, then Humane: in which regard alſo, perhaps, he choſe none of the Doctours with whom he argued: ſure I am, S. Auguſtine ſaith, for this very cauſe Nathanael was not numbred among the twelve Apoſtles, <hi>Quia doctus erat in lege, Becauſe he was a learned Lawyer;</hi> though otherwiſe Nathanael was a moſt accompliſhed men. Act. 4.13. it is ſaid, That the high Prieſts, Rulers, and Elders <hi>perceived that Peter and John were unlearned and ignorant men:</hi> Unlearned in the knowledge of things themſelves; ignorant in skilfull ſpeaking: ſimple men both for matter and manner. And <hi>this the Jews perceived, that is, by diſquiſition found out,</hi> ſaith Lorinus.</p>

               <p>That S. Jude had the hiſtorie of the ſtrife between Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and the devil, about the bodie of Moſes (the 9 of Jude) in part from Deuteronomie, and in part from an Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall book, Aretius maintaineth: The title of the book was <hi>Aſſumptio Moſis, The aſſumption of Moſes</hi> (as ſome ſay;) or, <hi>Aſcenſio Moſis, The aſcent of Moſes,</hi> as others ſay. That S. Jude might alſo have read the book of Henoch and his propheſie, I will not denie: for he citeth ſome words of it, verſ. 14. So think Hierom <hi>in Catalogo,</hi> and in his Commentarie on Titus 1. Auguſtine <hi>de Civitat.</hi> 15.23. <hi>&amp; ibid.</hi> 18.38. and Beda on the place. But the book of Henoch is Apocryphall.</p>
               <p>That S. John read the Targumiſts, in many places, the learned Heinſius proveth or laboureth to prove by many paſſages. Thus much clearly muſt be confeſt, that the gifts both of reading, and of writing, and underſtanding of ſtrange tongues
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6913:164"/>was conferred on all the Apoſtles; not one was an illiterate man, after the <hi>cloven tongues like as of fire ſat upon each of them,</hi> Act. 2.3. and I make no queſtion but they alſo read the Old Teſtament, after that time, and might reade other books, Talmudiſts, Targumiſts, Helleniſts, Apocryphall books, yea Heathen writings; and perhaps did ſo.</p>
               <p>But in all theſe or the like places, which the Apoſtles ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or pointed at, this is now my laſt reſolution, as a Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie to the Queſtion before briefly anſwered,</p>
               <p>Either the ſacred Penmen never read thoſe things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the all-knowing Spirit did tender and dictate both matter and words to them: Or if they did reade profane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, and were converſant in them; yet they uſed the words, not as their own reading, not as humane learning, not as drawn out of the treaſurie of their own memories, not as if they had the choice to inſert thoſe ſentences above others; but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſts inſpiration guided them wholly, and reached forth words unto them, both in things which they knew, and in things unknown unto them before.</p>
               <p>Yea, I beleeve, that if Plato, or Ariſtotle, Tullie, or Varro had lived after Chriſts dayes, and been called to write any part of Scripture, they ſhould not, would not have conceived one thought, or written one word of humane literature, as from themſelves, or any part of their own great knowledge; but would have quitted themſelves, and been wholly led by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Queſtion. Whether they ſtudied the things before-hand?</p>
               <p>That both Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, were filled with holy thoughts, and heavenly meditations, we certainly beleeve and know. Pſal. 45.1. <hi>My heart is enditing of a good matter;</hi> or (as it is in our margin) <hi>boyleth,</hi> or <hi>bubbleth up a good matter: Eructavit cor meum verbum bonum,</hi> ſaith the Vulgat; <hi>Verily good thoughts were in my heart:</hi> The like I ſay of all, and every of them. Pſal. 39.2. <hi>I was dumbe with ſilence, I held my peace even from good, and my ſorrow was ſtirred:</hi> and verſ. 3. <hi>My heart was hot within me, while I was muſing the fire burned; then ſpake I with my tongue:</hi> and verſ. 4. <hi>Lord, make me to know mine end.</hi> From whence appeareth, that David was premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, as other people do: and at the laſt, as other mens, his thoughts brake forth. The ſimilitude is taken from ſorrow and grief, which being for a while ſuppreſſed, groweth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or from fire, which being ſmothered, or half quenched with water, upon recovery of its ſtrength, groweth farre more violent. The anſwer is, that David relateth what courſe he took when he could not exonerate and alleviate his ſoul by conference with men, whoſe wayes he liked not: <hi>He poured
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6913:164"/>out his complaints and prayers unto God:</hi> So Muſculus. And this no doubt did the Spirit of God ſtirre him up to do. It pleaſed the holy Ghoſt to make thoſe thoughts of David, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were pure and divine, yet private, now to be divine, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and canonicall.</p>
               <p>Again, That they might conceive and underſtand by the Spirit, a great deal more then the holy Ghoſt would have to be written, I denie not: and on ſuch things they might muſe.</p>
               <p>Yet I conjecture, that what they wrote in holy Scripture, they ſtudied not before-hand (the Spirit hath no need of mans ſtudie or learning) and I do remove from every part of it, all humane premeditation; and maintain, that the Spirit did frame both matter and words (as by Gods grace ſhall anon appeare) <hi>pro re nata, as occaſion offered it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One chief reaſon may be this, That nature, which is the right hand of God, hath greateſt care of greateſt matters, and leſſe of leaſt, and equall care of things equall. If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall and Evangelicall writings are not <hi>(conſideratis conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derandis, weighing one thing with an other)</hi> of more eſteem then their words were; yet let them go as equivalent: Then Chriſt will have as much care of their writings as of their ſpeaking: But their ſpeeches were without premeditation, and were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo to be: Therefore all their writings. Matth. 10.19. <hi>Take no thought how, or what ye ſhall ſpeak:</hi> you ſee both the matter and manner is not to be from them. <hi>For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>Not they,</hi> there is the negative; <hi>but the Spirit,</hi> there is the poſitive. Likewiſe, Mark 13.11. <hi>Take no thought before-hand, —neither do ye premeditate:</hi> An abſolute inhibition; and it had been a great ſinne to tranſgreſſe it, and a diſtruſt of the holy Ghoſt. The like I ſay concerning all their writings.</p>
               <p>They might have indeed in their meditation before-hand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of thoſe things which afterwards they wrote: but when they thought on them, they knew not they ſhould write them; and when they did write, they wrote them not as copies or extracts of former conceits out of the wombe of their own memories; but as freſhly and newly inſpired, apprehended, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and dictated unto them.</p>
               <p>There is one kinde of knowledge proceeding from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples known by the naturall light of the intellect: as Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, Geometrie, &amp;c. Others proceed out of principles known by light of an higher knowledge: as Perſpective, from the principles evinced by Geometrie; and Muſick, from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples known by Arithmetick: <hi>So is the Scripture beleeved by an higher light, even by the revelation of God,</hi> ſaith Aquin. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 2. and not beleeved onely; but the matter, and manner, and words proceeded from a diviner underſtanding,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6913:165"/>then humane conceit could reach unto; and were written by an higher and better hand then the hand of man. All was the holy Spirits doing, even the leading of their hands whileſt they wrote, that they could not erre.</p>
               <p>Cornelius Cornelii à Lapide, on 2. Tim. 3.16. thus, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did not dictate all Scripture after one manner. The Law and the Propheſies are revealed and dictated to a word; the Hiſtories and Morall exercitations, which before by ſight, hearing, reading, or meditation the holy Writers had learned, there was no neceſsitie to be inſpired, or dictated from the Spirit; ſince they knew them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie: So John</hi> 19.35. <hi>He that ſaw it, bare record: and Luk.</hi> 1.3. <hi>It ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, to write unto thee in order:</hi> Then doth he mince, modifie, and qualifie his former ſaying, in this manner; <hi>But the holy Spirit may be ſaid to have dictated even the latter alſo: Firſt, becauſe
<note n="q" place="margin">Aſtitit ſcribentibus nè vel in puncto à veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate aberrarent.</note> he was preſent whileſt they wrote, that they could not go one jot from the truth: Secondly, becauſe it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them up, and ſuggeſted that they ſhould write this rather then that:
<note n="r" place="margin">Conceptum ergò, &amp; memoriam corum quae ſciebant, non iis ingeſſit Spiritus Sanctus.</note> Therefore the conceptions and remembrance of ſuch things as they knew, the Spirit did not inſpire into them.</hi> Thirdly, ſaith he, <hi>The Spirit did order, direct, and methodize all their conceits, that they might put this in the firſt, that in the ſecond, another in the third place.</hi> In which words of his three things deſerve cenſure, even the ſtrict cenſure of the Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Spirit did not dictate all Scripture after one manner.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Then all is not of a like dignitie: that which is after the divineſt manner, is to be held beſt: that wherein there is a medly of divine and humane knowledge and wiſdome, is of an inferiour ſort. But this may not be granted; for, <hi>All Scripture is of divine inſpiration.</hi> Excellently ſaith Doctour Eſtius on 2. Tim. 3.16. <hi>Rightly and moſt truely from hence do we conclude, that all the ſacred Canonicall Scripture was written by the dictate of the holy Spirit;</hi> (not in that manner, ſay I, that he left the Penmen to their own memories and knowledge, which as humane were weak and imperfect) but
<note n="f" place="margin">Ità nimirum, ut non ſolùm ſententiae, ſed &amp; verba ſingula, &amp; verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ordo, ac tota diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio ſit à Deo, tanquam per ſemetipſum loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te aut ſcribente.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo, that not onely the ſentences, but every word, and the order, placing, and the whole diſpoſing of the words was from God, as ſpeaking or writing by himſelf.</hi> But God (I dare ſay) hath no need of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; nor his writing or ſpeech, of their hearing, reading, ſight, or premeditation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is to be taxed for ſaying, there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie that things Morall and Hiſtoricall ſhould be inſpired.</p>
               <p>I ſay, there was a neceſſitie that hiſtories and moralities ſhould be inſpired, if they are to be parts of the ſacred Writ: otherwiſe, this knowledge and writing are onely parcels of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning. Though S. John bare record to what he ſaw,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6913:165"/>his bearing record without the Spirit, had been but an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary teſtimonie. Not his ſaying, but the inſpiration makes the record divine: and his teſtimonie from the Spirit, That he ſaw, is of more force then his teſtimonie could be to the Spirit, What he ſaw. <hi>It ſeemeth good unto me,</hi> ſaith S. Luke; but it was made to ſeem good unto him by the Spirit: yea, firſt it ſeemed good unto the holy Ghoſt; as the Apoſtles in the like caſe ſaid, Act. 15.28. <hi>It ſeemed good unto the holy Ghoſt, and to us.</hi> The words do not notifie the pleaſing of his own fancie, without the dictate of the holy Ghoſt, ſay I. And the underſtanding that he had of things from the firſt, was not by ſight; for he was not then called: nor by humane relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that may be miſtaken, increaſed, or decreaſed, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour. But the knowledge iſſued out from the light divine; and therefore is there tearmed <hi>perfect underſtanding;</hi> like Gods gifts, James 1.17. All other guides are ſomewhat imperfect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Jeſuite is juſtly blameable for ſaying, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit need not tell them what they knew before.</p>
               <p>I ſay, they might have forgotten or miſtaken ſome things, as they were men; and by the Spirit they might know more certainly, what they knew before more doubtingly; and by the ſame Spirit they might know ſome circumſtances more then before they knew: what they knew <hi>humanely,</hi> they now know <hi>divinely.</hi>

               <p>I will not diſcuſſe the queſtion at large, Whether the Law written by the hand and finger of God immediately, were to be regarded above other things divinely inſpired into holy men, and written by them. This I will ſay, That if I were aſcertained that I ſaw the very tables, the latter tables of ſtone which God himſelf wrote; or if I had ſeen any thing which Chriſt himſelf had written (for I will not ſay he wrote nothing; and I know he could write) I ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them ſomewhat above whatſoever ſhould be tranſcribed or written by any other whoſoever: and this is my reaſon; Though Moſes his writings were inſpired and dictated from God; yet he placed them in the ſide of the Ark, Deut. 31.26. a place not altogether ſo noble: (ſee Cajetan on Heb. 9.) but the tables, and onely the tables written by Gods own finger, were laid up in the Ark it ſelf; as appeareth, 1. Kings 8.9. and 2. Chron. 5.10. howſoever afterward it ſeemeth there was a change, Hebr. 9.4.</p>
               <p>At length I am come to the five Concluſions, which beat directly upon the learned Heinſius: whereof the firſt is this,
<q>
                     <hi>There was no difference between the Penmen of the divine Writ of the Old and New Teſtament in the point of conceiving and writing in different languages.</hi>
                  </q> Which in this manner I do explain;</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:6913:166"/>
               <p>If I demand of the worthy Heinſius, in what tongue the Old Teſtament was conceived: his anſwer is peremptorie, <hi>Prolegom. pag.</hi> 26.
<note n="f" place="margin">Hebraeâ ac Chaldaeâ conceptum eſt linguâ.</note> 
                  <hi>It was conceived in the Hebrew and Chaldee language.</hi> It had been clearer if he had uſed ſome disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, rather then a copulative Prepoſition. For none will imagine that the skilfull Heinſius did ever mean, that all of the Old Teſtament was conceived both in Hebrew and in Chaldee, to which his words ſeem to incline: but either in Hebrew or in Chaldee was it conceived; and they who wrote in Hebrew conceived in Hebrew; and they who wrote in Chaldee conceived in Chaldee. I do not think but he would thus have expreſſed himſelf, and explained his own meaning, if he had been put unto it. Whereupon I diſcourſe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Jeremie wrote ſomewhat in Chaldee, and Daniel wrote ſome chapters: If they being Hebrews or Jews by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and birth, and perfect in their mother-tongue, readie Scribes in the law of Moſes, as well as Ezra, Ezra 7.6. did yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the Chaldee, that Chaldee which they wrote (which the ingenuous Heinſius will not denie: for what was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chaldee, if that which was written in Chaldee was not ſo conceived?) why did not the Writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they were born and bred in the uſe of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, conceive in Greek what they wrote in Greek? What reaſon have we to diſcriminate them: ſo that the Penmen of the Old, ſhall conceive and write in one and the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Chaldee in Chaldee, and Hebrew in Hebrew; and not the Penmen of the New Teſtament? but they (forſooth) muſt conceive in Syriack, and write or dictate in Greek? eſpecially ſince all of them conceived and wrote by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and dictate of one and the ſame Spirit? Either let him make the forenamed paſſages of the Chaldee language in the Old Teſtament to be conceived in Hebrew, though writ in Chaldee; and ſo none at all to be conceived in Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee: or let him equall the Penmen of the New Law to thoſe of the Old in this point, That they wrote in the ſelf-ſame tongue in which they conceived.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it will be hard to prove, that Jeremie ever knew any part of the Chaldean language, till that very verſe was inſpired into him: and ſo with it, both the knowledge, and the words, and the power both of pronuntiation and of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So that Jeremie could not poſſibly conceive and utter alſo the Chaldee in the Hebrew; but conceived that verſe in Chaldee, and in Chaldee pronounced or wrote it.</p>
               <p>A ſecond errour in the learned Heinſius, <hi>Pag.</hi> 49. <hi>Prolegom.</hi> is this,
<note n="t" place="margin">Quare ad alluſiones, non quae extant, ſed quas animo conceperat Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, eundum eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore we muſt reſt not on the alluſions which now are, but which S. John conceived in his minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt which I ſet down the ſecond Concluſion; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:6913:166"/>
               <p>We muſt have recourſe to the alluſions which are. S. John was <hi>Sol Evangelii, The light, the ſunſhine, the very Sunne of the Goſpel,</hi> as Dionyſius termed him: This Sunne is in eclipſe, and we have not, cannot have his true and perfect light, if we muſt not look to his rayes and ſhine, which are his words; but to his thoughts, that is, the light which is in himſelf; to his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> light, and not to the <hi>externall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The certaineſt rule is moſt to be truſted unto: therefore let us not go from the words and extant alluſions which we know, to the thoughts of S. John which we know not. For, <hi>Who knoweth the thoughts of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him?</hi> 1. Cor. 2.11. And if the finite thought of every man be unknown, can the thoughts of him, who is inſpired by the infinite Spirit, be ſo ſoon and ſo eaſily known? Moreover, the ſame words written in Greek may be conceived two or three wayes in the Syriack: for variations are in that language, and different expreſſions of the ſame things; And which of thoſe ſhall we think was the conceit of S. John? And when we have lighted on divers, and all of them good expreſſions of Syriack; yet the Spirit might guide S. John to an other, which we never thought upon: And ſo we are for ever uncertain what alluſion S. John conceived in his thoughts. For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more by the boundleſſe power of the divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then we can poſſibly reach unto: and there was never place of Scripture ſo, ſince the Apoſtles dayes, expounded, (if before) that I dare ſay, The Spirit aimed at nothing elſe, and all is known. All known good expoſitions may be ſaid to be of the Spirit, but the Spirit hath many depths which never yet were ſearched. Therefore our anchor-hold muſt be on the words; or elſe we ſhall flote in the wide vaſt ſea of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and phanſie, without ſail, oar, or rudder, without card or compaſſe; by having recourſe to the <hi>Non entes,</hi> or <hi>Non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes alluſiones, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nextant alluſions,</hi> which were in the thoughts of our bleſſed Apoſtle. It is no rule or canon which is not extant. <hi>Non Ens</hi> is an ill guide to <hi>Ens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the Syriack now much differeth from that in the Apoſtles dayes: how then can we finde out, what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle conceived? For the Syriack and Arabick now in uſe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps the Goſpel of S. Matthew, and the Epiſtle to the Hebrews) were tranſlated out of the Greek, and not the Greek out of theſe. Had we exactly the identicall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>firſt originall manuſcripts,</hi> in which S. Matthew wrote his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and S. Paul his Epiſtle to the Hebrews, in the Hebrew or Syriack; had we the true ſelf-ſame paper or parchment, in which the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles or their <hi>amanuenſes</hi> wrote the divine dictates; we might better gueſſe at their thoughts and the alluſions to which they bended themſelves. But now
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6913:167"/>Heinſius would have us to ſhoot at rovers; or rather to no ſteadie mark at all, at the then thoughts of our Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the worthy Heinſius doth a little interfere, when he counſelleth us to go to the alluſions which were in the thoughts of the Apoſtles, and not to the alluſions which are extant: For ſuppoſe I grant that he hath found whatſoever the Apoſtle alluded to in his minde; is not this now extant? Or can a thing be found which is not extant?</p>
               <p>The third concluſion trenching upon Heinſius is this,
<q>They had no libertie left unto them to put in their own conceits, or in writing to adde or blot out what they had done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This point concerneth the matter which is written.</p>
               <p>Peter Moulin in his third Epiſtle to Biſhop Andrews, as it is in the 182 page of the ſaid Biſhops <hi>Opuſcula,</hi> wrote thus;
<note n="a" place="margin">Quae ad ſalutem &amp; fidem pertinent, ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolis ſtatuta ſunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatu divino; in caeteris, ſaepe uſi ſunt ſuâ pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiâ, ut innuit Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius.</note> 
                  <hi>What things ſoever concern faith or ſalvation, they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Apoſtles under the guidance of divine inſpirations. In other things they often uſed their own diſcretion and prudence, as S. Paul intimateth,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.25. The grave and profound Oracle thus anſwereth him, pag. 193.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>I pray you ſpeak more ſparingly of this point,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Apoſtles uſed their own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or prudence: for it is dangerous to ſay or write, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were in ſome things inſpired from heaven; in the reſt often uſed their own counſel and prudence, and that in matters which are found written in the Scripture. But you know it is concluded imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after theſe words,</hi> ACCORDING TO MY OPINION, <hi>or judgement;</hi> AND I THINK ALSO THAT I HAVE THE SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT OF GOD, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.40. <hi>So that his very opinion or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had its dictate from the Spirit of God.</hi> Again, <hi>If the place cited were not inſpired, but written in humane prudence; we muſt note it as Apocryphal. Then let us make an expurgatorie index of the New Teſtament. For we muſt ſeparate that which is precious from that which is vile. Things of humane wiſdome will never ſtand mixed with things divinely inſpired.</hi> So farre he. Enough indeed for an Epiſtle; but I could have wiſhed that the moſt learned walking-librarie had more fully anſwered all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which do moſt forcibly arietate the truth; eſpecially ſuch as are couched in the ſame chapter, which is cited by Peter Moulin. If I come upon the ſtage after Roſcius, I look not for praiſe, but pardon. Let us muſter up all their forces together: and ſince that famous Biſhop hath withſtood the utmoſt of their ſtrength in the firſt brunt; the reſt will (like the French furie in warre) be the eaſier anſwered.</p>
               <p>The firſt objection is, 1. Cor. 7.6. <hi>I ſpeak this by permiſsion, and not of commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond objection is, verſ. 10. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the married I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet not I, but the Lord:</hi> as if he had ſaid, A common man may ſpeak, and both deceive, and be deceived; but I ſay theſe things being taught of God.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:6913:167"/>
               <p>The third objection is, verſ. 12. <hi>To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth objection, verſ. 25. <hi>Concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercie of the Lord to be faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth objection, verſ. 40. <hi>She is happier, if ſhe ſo abide, after my judgement: and I think alſo that I have the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt I thus anſwer, The Apoſtle meaneth not, that he was permitted onely to write or ſpeak ſome things, and commanded to write other things: nor touched it any part of his thought, to permit a little ſinne, that a greater might be avoided, as ſome hence maintain;

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I command, yet not I, but the Lord.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, that thoſe forms of ſpeech are not ſimply <hi>excluſive,</hi> much leſſe <hi>contradictorie;</hi> and denote not ſo much a ſimple <hi>negation</hi> as a kinde of <hi>compariſon</hi> ſometime: <hi>I, yet not I.</hi> And we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Scripture to be ranked in the ſame parallell: John 7.16. <hi>My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> As therefore it was moſt true, that Chriſts doctrine, even as he is God and Man, is not his in one ſenſe, that is, <hi>originally;</hi> (for as he had not the divine eſſence of himſelf, or from himſelf, but from God the Father; ſo from the Father had he the divine doctrine) and yet in another ſenſe is truely Chriſts doctrine; as conceived and preached by him who is God, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of truth, yea Truth it ſelf. And as the doctrine which he had as he was Man, was partly not his, (for the infuſed doctrine into the ſoul of Chriſt, comprehending all ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call habits, by which Chriſt naturally knew, and that moſt perfectly, whatſoever was to be known, was not his as Man, but was infuſed of God) and partly his, namely ſuch as he, like a Viator or another Man, experimentally might gather. And the true meaning of the words may be, <hi>The doctrine which I preach is not the invention of mine own brain, but his rather
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6913:168"/>who ſent me, to teach you what he taught me: and ſo is both mine, and not mine:</hi> To which effect Pererius. So in the place of the Apoſtle where it is written, <hi>I command, yet not I, but the Lord;</hi> ſince S. Paul might be conſidered either as an ordinarie man, or as an Apoſtle inſpired from God: he firſt ſaith, <hi>I command;</hi> and then by diſtinguiſhing explaineth his meaning, <hi>Yet not I,</hi> as a common man, <hi>but</hi> rather <hi>the Lord,</hi> by me his Apoſtle. And all this proveth not that S. Paul could write any thing as he was an Apoſtle, of his own head; or yet put in any of his own conceits: but was wholly guided by the Spirit. For, whatſoever is ſo properly mans work, that it is not alſo Gods, that is not good; ſince the Authour of goodneſſe is excluded.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwer, The place doth rather expreſſely ſay, that whatſoever S. Paul wrote or ſpake as an Apoſtle, they were not his words or writings, but the words of God (for his commands were not his, but the Lords) then any way imply that he could write any thing as an Apoſtle, without the Spirit, or by the dictate of his own naturall prudence onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note n="o" place="margin">Praecipio non ego ex mea ſententia, ſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus in Evangelio, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>I command not according to mine opinion, but the Lord in the Goſpel doth, That a man may not depart from his wife except for fornication,</hi> ſaith Haymo. Where our Saviour ſpeaks not of a ſhort departure with conſent, for the improvement of religious duties (for then S. Paul might have had a command for it in the objection precedent:) but our Saviour ſpeaketh of a totall or finall departure of man and wife by bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement or ſeparation: for of this Chriſt ſpake expreſſely, Mat. 19.9. Mark 10.11. Luk. 16.18. Therefore S. Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not, but the Lord; namely Chriſt in thoſe places of the Goſpel to which he aimed.</p>
               <p>The third objection is out of the 1. Cor. 7.12. <hi>To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord.</hi> Theſe words compared with the former may ſeem to carrie it cleare againſt me. For what can be of more force? <hi>I command, yet not I, but the Lord;</hi> and, <hi>To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord:</hi> as if S. Paul ſpake and wrote ſomething by humane wiſdome, which the Lord bid him not. Firſt, I anſwer with Peter Martyr, S. Paul ſaith thus, becauſe before he had reference to Chriſts ſpeech in the Goſpel, of not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſſolving matrimonie: but now he ſets down ſomewhat, of which Chriſt in the Goſpel is not found to have ſaid any thing. So now <hi>he</hi> ſpeaks, not <hi>the Lord:</hi> namely, not <hi>Chriſt in the Goſpel,</hi> not <hi>Chriſt by word of mouth as he was man:</hi> and yet on the contrarie ſide, we may as truely ſay even in this place, and to S. Pauls proper ſenſe, with the words inverted, <hi>The Lord ſpeaks, not I:</hi> Not I, of my ſelf; not I, as a man: but God from heaven, or the holy Spirit ſpeaketh.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:6913:169"/>
               <p>The concluſion is, S. Paul ſpeaketh or writeth nothing as an Apoſtle from himſelf, without the Lord, without divine imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelation from the holy Ghoſt: but he might relate ſomething which Chriſt ſpake not whileſt Chriſt lived on earth; ſomething that is not regiſtred in the Goſpel: And thus S. Paul did ſpeak, and not the Lord: And thus may an other ſpeak or write, and not the Lord.

                  <hi>I ſpeak, not the Lord: Did not the Lord ſpeak by him? Yes.

And indeed, I remember not that Chriſt ſo much as toucheth at this point; Whether a beleeving man ſhould put away, or dwell from an unbeleeving woman, yea or no?</p>
               <p>To the fourth objection, 1. Cor. 7.25. <hi>I have no command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Lord, yet I give my judgement,</hi> I anſwer, It was matter of <hi>counſel,</hi> not of <hi>precept;</hi> it was left indifferent; the doing, or not doing had not been ſinne.
<note n="q" place="margin">Noluit Deus de vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitate &amp; coelibatu praecipere, quia viſus fuiſſet damnare nuptias</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt would give no command concerning ſingle life or virginitie, leſt he ſhould ſeem to condemn marriage.</hi> So Auguſtine, <hi>in libello de ſanct. virginit.</hi> So Hierom againſt Jovinian: So Ambroſe, ſaith Peter Martyr.

                  </gap>, <hi>foot by foot.</hi> So this place proveth not that the Apoſtle as an Apoſtle wrote or ſpake by humane wiſdome any thing, but what was appointed of God.</p>
               <p>The Rhemiſts on verſe 12 ſay, <hi>By this we learn, that there were many matters over and above the things that Chriſt taught or preſcribed, left to the Apoſtles order and interpretation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might, as the caſe required, either command or counſel; and we bound to obey accordingly.</hi> Doctour Eſtius goeth further:
<note n="r" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>This ſpeech,</hi> I COMMAND, YET NOT I, BUT THE LORD, <hi>doth ſufficiently evidence, that the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſomething which Chriſt himſelf by himſelf commanded not.</hi> Both of them runne awry in one extream. Doctour Fulk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to that place of the Rhemiſts; <hi>The Apoſtles had not particular precepts for every caſe; but they had generall rules in Chriſts doctrine, which they were bound to follow in their precepts and counſels.</hi> I think he approacheth too nigh unto them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he mean that both their precepts and counſels had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dictate to guide them; eſpecially in things which they wrote. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>They had not particular precepts
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6913:169"/>for every caſe,</hi> I ſay, they had for all caſes neceſſarie: eſpecially concerning the whole Church. And their generall rules might rather be for guiding matters of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſcipline,</hi> then of <hi>doctrine.</hi> For he that promiſed to lead them into all truth, would not leave them in the framing of particulars; as he doth us and other men, who out of generals do deduce theſe and theſe ſpecials. For there is a great diſtance and traverſe to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced between thoſe ſacred Penmen, and other ſucceeding Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours of holy Writ. And S. Paul doth imply, that even his judgement or counſel was according to the Spirit of God; as Biſhop Andrews well obſerved, and now cometh to be handled.</p>
               <p>The fifth objection is verſe 40: in the ſame verſe where he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>According to my judgement,</hi> he addeth, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Puto autem. <hi>Sobriè loquitur, minúſque dicit &amp; majus ſignificat; ut ſit ſenſus,</hi> Certò ſcio.</note> I THINK. <hi>He ſpeaketh ſoberly, ſignifying more then he ſpake; and it is all one as if he had ſaid,</hi> I KNOW CERTAINLY, ſaith Dionyſius Carthuſ. with whom accordeth Primaſius, <hi>Do not think that I ſpeak what I do of my ſelf; the Spirit of God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me:

                     </note> The word</hi> I THINK <hi>is not wrapped about with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</hi> Peter Martyr thinks it is an Ironie againſt the falſe Apoſtles, who traduced S.

And then the Ironie hath as full force, as if he had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily avouched, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is in me, and by it I write what I write.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other objections may be made, as the 2. Cor. 11.17. <hi>I ſpeak it not after the Lord, but as it were fooliſhly in this confidence of boaſting.</hi> Therefore not onely humane wiſdome, but humane infirmitie may ſeem to challenge part both in his words and writings. It is anſwered in a few words of Dionyſius Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſianus, <hi>Non loquor, id eſt, Loqui non videor:</hi> that is, <hi>It ſeems not ſo to ſome, though my ſelf know the contrarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others may object, 1. Cor. 9.8. <hi>Say I theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo?</hi> I anſwer, that he might ſpeak or write ſome things like an other man, ſome things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſed in their Law; but now he ſpeaketh or writeth (for they are both one ſenſe in this notion) as an Apoſtle; who therefore was equally to be regarded (as a Penman of the <hi>Law of Grace)</hi> with Moſes, a Penman of the <hi>Law Leviticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may yet be objected what S. John ſaith, 2. Epiſt. verſ. 12. <hi>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ink:</hi> and 3. Epiſt. John ver. 13. <hi>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee.</hi> From whence a power ſeemeth to be wholly left in him, both whether he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6913:170"/>would write or no, and what he would write. I anſwer to both places; If he had ſaid he had writ any thing without or beyond the Spirit, or what he was bid not to write; he had ſpoken home to the purpoſe: but theſe words do not imply that he had either power or will to write any thing of his own head, or by the wiſdome or learning of man; but they fully evidence, that the holy Ghoſt had ſuggeſted many things unto him, which the ſame bleſſed Spirit would not have him to write; as being fitter perhaps to be delivered face to face, and not concerning poſteritie.</p>
               <p>If I knew any more oppoſite arguments, I would endeavour their anſwer. The poſitive proofs I referre to the laſt point of all; it being the very main hinge of the controverſie. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider this one thing, <hi>The Scripture hath a priviledge above all other writings.</hi> Aquinas on 2. Timoth. 3.15. giveth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<note n="u" place="margin">Quia aliae traditae ſunt per rationem bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam; ſacra autem Scriptura eſt divina.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe other writings ſavour of humane reaſon; but the Scripture is divine:</hi> Where he excludeth the prudence of man from compoſing any Scripture. If any earthly wiſdome wrote any part of it, it is no more to be accounted our Scripture. Let this ſuffice for the third concluſion, concerning the matter of Scripture: wherein the holy Penmen had no libertie left them to put in their own conceits; or in writing to adde or blot out what they had done: whereby all humane literature and wiſdome is removed from ſharing part in the holy Writ.</p>
               <p>The fourth concluſion followeth, concerning the manner of writing: <hi>viz.</hi> They had no libertie to clothe their inward apprehenſions with words of their own. Either all the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had the libertie, or none: (The disjunction ſtands upon a <hi>Da tertium, Give me a reaſon why ſome ſhould, and not others.</hi> Who were theſe ſome? and why thoſe?) But all had not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: (for the very words were dictated unto ſome of them) <hi>Ergò</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Either every Penman did apparrell his underſtanding with words of his own throughout all and every of his own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or it was practiſed in ſome places onely. If ſo, then again I enquire what places they were; and why thoſe had an eſpeciall priviledge above others.</p>
               <p>S. John indeed was bid to <hi>write the things which he had ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter,</hi> Revel. 1.19. I anſwer, This generall command evinceth not, that the holy Ghoſt did not adminiſter as well the words as the matter.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that the Evangelicall Prophet Iſaiah, and the Pſalmograph, and ſome others, are moſt eloquent in the Old; and in the New Teſtament, the beloved diſciple S. John is compared to an Eagle for his loftie flight; and S. Paul may ſeem to have brought ſome of the third heaven down with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6913:170"/>him; ſo heavenly is he: but Amos, and ſome others writ more plainly, in an homely ſtyle. I anſwer, If all this were true, yet it proveth not that any of them were left to expreſſe as they would their own dreams, viſions, or illuminations; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they frame and fit their ſtyles to the Spirit, or their words to the matter; nor indeed could they. For what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is there between <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>infinite?</hi> and how can the ſhallow capacitie of <hi>man</hi> comprehend the depth of <hi>God?</hi> God forbad the linſie-woolſie; and to the <hi>divine truths</hi> would he ſuffer them to adapt <hi>humane expreſsions?</hi> How often in the Old Teſtament, is both the matter put into their hearts, and the manner with the words into their mouthes? And is the Law of Grace of leſſe worth then the Law of Moſes? God forbid. But whoſoever readeth the Prophet Amos, and the reſt that are undervalued, ſhall finde more in Amos, then Amos; more in him then in one <hi>among the herd-men of Tekoa,</hi> Amos 1.1. and ſhall heare the piercing language of the Spirit in others: ſometimes perhaps attempering it ſelf to the partie writing, and making both words and matter eaſie; but at other times it rapteth him above himſelf, and maketh him (as it were) to prink it in loftie and almoſt undiſcernable towring; by infuſing things, phraſing ſentences, and dictating words above what was agreeable to the meanneſſe of his former calling.</p>
               <p>That the holy Ghoſt can and hath ſuggeſted the very words very often, I think none will denie. That ever he permitted them a libertie of many ſentences, of many phraſes, of many variations of words, to chooſe what they liked, and to refuſe the reſt; I think few ancient Divines ever ſaid before, but to that effect ſaith Heinſius. Els what can his meaning be, when he ſaith, S. John ſaw the Chaldee Paraphraſe, and Helleniſts, and had often reference to them; and that divers things were taken from the Targummim?
<note n="x" place="margin">Ad Targumiſtas ſemper reſpicit Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſta.</note> 
                  <hi>The Evangeliſt alwayes hath an eye to the Targumiſts,</hi> ſaith he, pag. 550. If the noble Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius had ſaid in any one place (which he did not, ſo farre as my remembrance now beareth) that the holy Spirit had guided S. John to thoſe Authours and authorities of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumiſts, Helleniſts, and Chaldee Paraphraſt; I ſhould have ſubſcribed, and ſat down at his feet. But when he ſo often appealeth from the Greek to the Syriack, and ſaith, S. John was ſo converſant with the forenamed Authours; he deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (in mine opinion) from the majeſtie of the holy Writ; whileſt he would ſeem to have ought of it taken from humane reading or wiſdome, though of an Apoſtle; unleſſe it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the holy Spirit guided the Apoſtle unto it, and did dictate it unto him, not as it was known before to the Apoſtle, but as the holy Ghoſt thought fit to make uſe of it, and to ſanctifie that part of humane literature: to dictate, I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6913:171"/>ſay, the words and ſyllables, yea every letter and iota; and in the writing to guide their hands aright; as a good maſter of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over-ſpreadeth and over-ruleth the hand of his ſcholar, and writeth what copie he pleaſeth, without reference or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſcholars former knowledge, but rather to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſtruction.</p>
               <p>This is that which againſt Heinſius may be averred, That though many things which are in S. John and other holy Penmen, were before in the Targum, Talmud, Helleniſts, Chaldee Paraphraſe, or any heathen Authours; yet it doth not neceſſarily evince, that the holy Actuaries or Notaries did overſee, reade, heare, or tranſcribe thoſe things out of their knowledge from the ſaid Authours: but both the names of thoſe Authours, and the things themſelves were preſented to them by that bleſſed Spirit which knew all things; and this among the reſt, That theſe words, phraſes, and ſentences, were fit to be inſerted into the holy Writ, which now are in it.</p>
               <p>All Scripture is of divine inſpiration: But the very words are part of Scripture: Therefore even they were inſpired.</p>
               <p>Revel. 19.9. The Angel ſaid, <hi>Write, Bleſſed are they which are called unto the marriage-ſupper of the Lambe.</hi> Did not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſpeak the words? Did not he give the Apoſtle both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words?</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle was commanded, Revel. 14.13. by a voice from heaven, to write, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> was he commanded to write his conceits and thoughts apprehended in Syriack, and tranſlate them into Helleniſticall Greek? or did the heavenly voice ſuggeſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an holy inſpiration into him, and left him to coyn words, as Heinſius would have it? or rather did not the voice teach the very words which ſhould be written, viz. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, &amp;c.?</hi> Now let us paſſe to the fifth and laſt Concluſion, in which we muſt diſſent from the worthy Heinſius, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm him of his often-inculcated, but not once proved Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</p>

All which ſhall be ſquared to that Corner-ſtone, which more then once before I hewed upon more roughly, and now (by Gods grace) intend to poliſh; namely, That the very words and letters were dictated unto the holy Scribes: and therefore they had no power to change or tranſchange, to adde or diminiſh; or to expreſſe by their own words their internall irradiation: but in the language

                     <hi>What is the mouth of the Lord, but the Scriptures, by which the Lord ſpeaketh?</hi> ſaith Rupert on Matth. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Philo Judaeus, <hi>in lib. Quis rerum divinarum haeres?</hi> thus,
<note n="e" place="margin">Propheta nihil ex ſe proloquitur; ſed omnia, ſubmonente alio.</note> 
                     <hi>A Prophet propheſieth nothing out of his own brain; but all things by the prompting of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> as he wittily concludeth. Therefore not ſo much as the words are his own.</p>
                  <p>Chryſoſtom, <hi>de Lazaro, Homil.</hi> 4. <hi>Though a dead man revive, and an Angel come from heaven, you muſt beleeve Scriptures above all: for the Maſter of Angels, the Lord of the living and the dead, he himſelf framed them.</hi> The ſame Chryſoſtom, <hi>de expulſione ipſius,</hi> ſheweth the manner. <hi>I reade his own handwriting, &amp;c.</hi> They are done by his hand; the very writing it ſelf is his: and therefore called <hi>Chyrographum Dei, A writing under Gods own hand,</hi> by Auguſtine, on Pſal. 144.</p>
                  <p>Now follow the Reaſons why they concelved and writ in the ſame tongue.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is little or no difference between the Apoſtles and other men, if the Apoſtles did frame words to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inſpirations. For when it pleaſeth the bleſſed Spirit, who bloweth where he liſteth, to drop down into the ſoul of an ordinary man ſome thoughts divine, and in the language of ſpirits ſaith unto the ſame ſoul, Of theſe ſee that you make a prayer; the righteous man accordingly obeyeth, and of thoſe inward apprehenſions ſhapeth a verbal prayer, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it forth before God Almightie, and ſetteth it down in writing: Shall the prayer be held as Divine as Scriptures? Then may Manaſſes his Apocryphall prayer, immediately before the books of Maccabees (as it is in our laſt tranſlation) be no longer Apocryphall, but Divine; as Divine as any prayer made by the ſelected holy Penmen. To have a thing perfectly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, is required that heavenly words may be mixed with heavenly illumination.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our faith will be queſtioned, if thoughts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and the Penmen ſhould adde what words they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<note n="f" place="margin">Titutabit fides, ſi Scripturarum vacillat authoritas.</note> 
                     <hi>Our faith will ſtumble, if the authoritie of the Scripture be ſhaken never ſo little,</hi> ſaith Auguſtine, <hi>de doctr. Chriſtian.</hi> 1.37. But the Scriptures authoritie ſhaketh, if God give onely the matter, and men the words.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Prophets and Apoſtles wrote not alwayes all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6913:172"/>their own things themſelves; but ſometimes uſed the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of divers others. A Scribe and a Prophet were two diſtinct perſons and offices, Jer. 36.26.</p>
                  <p>Jeremie had Baruch: Jer. 36.4. <hi>Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord:</hi> ſo then the words of Jeremiah to Baruch, were the words of the Lord to Jeremiah. And when that roll was burnt, Jeremiah by the word of the Lord, was bid <hi>to take another roll, and write in it,</hi> verſ. 28, &amp;c. Which Jeremie did, not by himſelf, but by <hi>Baruch the ſcribe,</hi> verſ. 32.</p>
                  <p>The nine firſt chapters of the Proverbs of Solomon were written by Solomon himſelf. The reſt were writ by others, who attended on Solomon and heard them: and are like ſo many precious ſtones apart, and ſeverally; though not made up into one jewell or chain, nor hanging together in any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led method; yet to be eſteemed at as high a rate and value as the very writings of Solomon. The ſame Spirit inſpired all, the ſame mouth ſpake all, though they were penned by ſeverall hands, by the command of the ſame holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>In the New Teſtament S. Paul wrote much <hi>with his own hand;</hi> The whole Epiſtle to the Galatians, Gal. 6.11. (at leaſt to theſe very words:) and to Philemon, verſ. 19.</p>
                  <p>Many ſaluations: 2. Theſſal. 3.17, 18. <hi>The ſaluation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every Epiſtle: ſo I write, The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> So that we may ſoundly gather, that whatſoever Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle under his name hath not that in it, it was not written by him. There was an Epiſtle written in his name to the Theſſalonians, terrifying them as if the generall judgement had been preſent: as may be gathered, 2. Theſſ. 2.2. But S. Paul diſclaims it. It had not (belike) the ſalutation with his own hand, his friendly farewell and prayer, which (ſaith Anſelm) was in theſe or the like words, <hi>Grace, &amp;c.</hi> as all the reſt of his Epiſtles have toward their end, though with a little vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of words; ſometimes larger, ſometimes briefer: even the Epiſtle to the Hebrews alſo, Hebr. 13.25. <hi>Grace be with you all. Amen.</hi> That you may not queſtion, but alſo that is his Epiſtle: whereas no other Apoſtles have it ſo fully; though S. Peter cometh neareſt him, 1. Pet. 5.14.</p>
                  <p>For all this, he uſed the help of ſome others in writing. <hi>All the ſecond Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians was written with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hand, except the ſalutation at the end,</hi> ſaith Eſtius. Rom. 16.22. <hi>I Tertius, who wrote this Epiſtle, ſalute you in the Lord.</hi> The words will bear this ſenſe, <hi>I Tertius, who wrote this Epiſtle in the Lord, ſalute you:</hi> or thus, (as the Vulgat hath it) <hi>I Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius ſalute you, who wrote this Epiſtle in the Lord. He ſaid,</hi> IN THE LORD, <hi>to ſhew that he wrote not for money,</hi> ſaith Cajetan.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6913:173"/>
                     <hi>Queſtionleſſe, Paul dictated, and Tertius wrote the Epiſtle,</hi> ſaith Eſtius. Even thoſe words themſelves are not Tertius his own, inſerted as a private mans or ſecretaries, but are divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And either by the Spirit he was commanded to write ſo, and that thought was from heaven put into his heart, and thoſe words into his mouth, to be written by his hand: or elſe (which I take to be moſt likely) S. Paul knowing the minde of Tertius, perhaps in part by Tertius his own expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but rather and chiefeſt by Divine revelation, that Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius did ſalute them in the Lord; he willed him ſo to write.</p>
                  <p>I hope Heinſius will not ſay, that Tertius conceived in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, and wrote in Greek: or, when S. Paul made his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Hebrew tongue, Act. 22.2. that Luke conceived in Syriack, and wrote in Greek: neither can he ſay the like of the holy ſecretaries, to whom not firſt thoughts in language ſpirituall, and then words; but thoughts by words outward and expreſſed were revealed. Yet Eraſmus in his laſt Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, ſaith thus,

                  <p>Again, Eraſmus on Hebr. 2. in his Anſwer to Fabers 57 ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, relateth that Faber,
<note n="h" place="margin">Quicquid eſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi &amp; off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>He commenceth a ſuit againſt the Interpreter of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</hi> All this ſhews Fabers opinion to be, That ſome writers of Scripture had power to uſe ſuch words as they pleaſed: and uſed ſome amiſſe, even ſuch as he found fault withall. O novell criticiſm! Wilt thou ſet thy ſelf no bounds till thou reacheſt up to heaven, and trampleſt on the word of God? The holy <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> were guided by the Spirit to <hi>write,</hi> as well as the Apoſtles to <hi>dictate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When S. Paul accounted, and would have his Galatians to account it as a favour above ordinary, that he wrote ſo large an Epiſtle as that to the Galatians with his own hand; and ſince the Epiſtle to the Romanes was larger then it, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6913:173"/>was writ by Tertius; let me probably collect, that other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of S. Paul, as thoſe to the Corinthians, and that to the Hebrews, and any other (if any other be longer and larger) were not written by S. Pauls own hand. For then his own writing had not been ſo great a teſtimonie and argument of his love to the Galatians: for the reſt were longer and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but were writ by ſome other hand, except perhaps the cloſe and ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Fevardentius, on 1. Pet. 5.12. and Salmeron, <hi>Tom.</hi> 13. <hi>Diſput.</hi> 5. (as they are cited by Lorinus, Act. 15.23.) do think that Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles wrote ſeldome with their own hands, but did dictate and ſubſcribe: which they prove by S. Peter, 1. Pet. 5.12. <hi>By Silvanus a faithfull brother unto you (as I ſuppoſe) I have written briefly.</hi> Lorinus anſwereth, That by the ſame reaſon, Judas and Silas wrote the Epiſtle of the Councel at Hieruſalem, Act. 15.23. Let me reply, That I ſee nothing to the contrary in the Text, or otherwhere, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das and Silas being <hi>chief men among the brethren,</hi> might write it as well as any others; and might alſo be joyned in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with others, to carrie it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which Penmen this is my opinion, <hi>That even they were led by the holy Ghoſt, both to conceive what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpake, and to write exactly what they dictated: ſo that they did not, they could not erre in writing any one word, ſyllable, or letter of the firſt Originals; no nor did, nor could miſ-accent it, or miſ-point any part thereof: nor can it be proved, nor ſeems it likely that ever the Apoſtles reviſed, or righted what the Penmen had done; but ſubſcribed to it, took it as their own, or rather as the holy Ghoſts, and ſealed it for divine Scripture.</hi> Oh that the firſt Originals themſelves of the New Teſtament, or of ſome part of it, could yet be found! I would go a thouſand miles on my bare feet to ſee them, kiſſe them, and in Tertullians phraſe, I would <hi>adore the plenitude of them.</hi> They would prove an Antidote againſt many hereſies, a correctorie of more falſe opinions which have ſprung up from the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Copies, and the uncertaintie what reading is beſt.</p>
                  <p>By this opinion, I am ſure, one firm anchor-hold is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; That humane wiſdome and skill is excluded from having part in any parcell of Scripture: and the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is by me maintained to be wholly and abſolutely true; certain, and moſt divine; which Heinſius and others ſeem not to do.

And this is apparent by the light of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; where there is a wall of ſeparation between the one and the other, Act. 7.15. <hi>Jacob died, he and our Fathers:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were ſome who were called Fathers, after Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob. <hi>Jacob died, he and our Fathers:</hi> Not Abraham and Iſaac; for they died before Jacob: but <hi>Jacob di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and who els? <hi>He, and our Fathers:</hi> What more? <hi>He, and our Fathers</hi> (when they were dead) <hi>were carried to Sychem.</hi> But Abraham and Iſaac were never carried to Sychem. Again, ſuch Fathers are meant as died in Egypt; (for they that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Canaan needed no carrying over to the place where they were) and <hi>Jacob went down into Egypt, and died</hi> there, <hi>he, and our Fathers.</hi> But Abraham, though he went down into Egypt, yet died not there; but he <hi>went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had,</hi> Geneſ. 13.1. leſt you might think, that he by leaving ought behinde might be occaſioned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into Egypt. And Iſaac was never in Egypt; therefore could not die there. Jacob died, and his bones were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the ſame ſepulchre where his father and grandfather lay; which was not in Sychem, but in Hebron: Therefore the word <hi>Fathers</hi> cannot be fitted in this place to Abraham, Iſaac, or Jacob; but to the twelve Patriarchs (as S. Stephen calleth them) the ſonnes of Jacob. For both Abraham and Sarah, Iſaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah, were buried <hi>in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah</hi> by Hebron, Gen. 49.31.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6913:175"/>but Joſeph his bones were buried in Sychem, Joſh. 24.32. Laſtly, the reſt of the Fathers the brethren of Joſeph were buried in Sychem, as well as Joſeph: for S. Hierom proveth it by their ſepulchres extant at Sychem, and viſited, as their ſepulchres, in his dayes; who is to be beleeved, and was an <hi>eye-witneſſe,</hi> ſaith Beza: So that the firſt-ſeeming contradiction is ſalved up: Joſeph and his brethren, the twelve Patriarchs, were thoſe Fathers which died after Jacob, and were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Sychem, and there buried: Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob were not thoſe Fathers: for onely one of them died in Egypt, and all three were buried by Hebron, and needed not to be, nor were tranſlated to Sychem.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſemblance of the ſecond oppoſite propoſition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth me to handle this point, Whether the brethren of Joſeph, the twelve Patriarchs, were buried in the ſepulchre of Abraham at Hebron, which he bought, and where himſelf was buried. Joſephus, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 2.8. ſaith, <hi>All the ſonnes of Jacob were buried in Hebron, except Joſeph, who was buried in Sychem.</hi> Yea the words of S. Stephen are very punctuall, That the Fathers were laid in the ſepulchre which Abraham bought. On the contrary, we proved before, that the ſonnes of Jacob were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Sychem. Some do anſwer, <hi>Poſiti ſunt in ſepulchro, They were laid in the grave,</hi> is to be referred to Jacob onely; and that the Scripture uſeth the plurall number ſometimes, when in exactneſſe it belongeth to one onely; <hi>poſiti</hi> for <hi>poſitus, more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi> for <hi>one buried.</hi> But this is forced, and the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie remaineth, concerning the names of them that ſold the ground.</p>
               <p>The maker of the School-hiſtorie, Carthuſian, and Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neius, ſay, <hi>The twelve Patriarchs dying in Egypt, were buried in Sychem, and then tranſlated to Hebron; and the monuments of their ſepulchres might be in both places.</hi> And ſo all may be true, what S. Stephen, Joſephus, and Hierom ſay. Of this tranſlation of their bodies (which I approve not) more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The true way of anſwering even to this point, will be found in the attoning of the third different propoſition. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham bought the ſepulchre of the ſonnes of Hemor,</hi> ſaith S. Stephen: <hi>Abraham bought the ſepulchre of Ephron the ſonne of Zohar,</hi> ſaith Moſes, Gen. 23.8. &amp;c. Some ſay the ground was twice bought, once by Abraham, once by Jacob: others ſay, the ground and the men had each of them ſeverall names, and that Ephron was called Hemor. Others ſay, with ſome likelihood, that the father of Ephron, of whom Abraham bought the ground and the cave, had two names; the one was <hi>Zohar,</hi> Geneſ. 23.8. the other <hi>Hemor,</hi> and ſo called by S. Stephen. Neither can I ſay ought againſt theſe expoſitions, ſave this, That I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove them but conjecture.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:6913:175"/>
               <p>But others, who no way can digeſt that the twelve Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were buried in Sychem, and thence tranſlated to Hebron, but ſay that their bones, bodies, and ſepulchres remained at Sychem, are driven to flie unto this ſtrong hold, That Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham bought not the ſepulchre of the ſonnes of Hemor, nor did S. Stephen mean ſo; but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> is taken <hi>patronymicé:</hi> for the fathers name is often uſed for the childe or children; as Iſrael, Edom, Moab, for their off-ſpring. So Geneſ. 11.12. <hi>Arphaxad begat Salah:</hi> Where Arphaxad is ſet for his ſonne: for Arphaxad begat Cainan, and Cainan begat Salah, Luk. 3.36. Likewiſe, 1.

Again, Abraham is ſaid to be <hi>Levi his father,</hi> Heb. 7.10. but Jacob was Levi his immediate father: ſo even there <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſome ſort ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the room of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> is taken for <hi>Jacob.</hi> Yea, I may boldly and truely proceed yet further, and ſay, that David is called <hi>the father of Ezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.5. though there were twelve generations from David to him: and David is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the ſonne of Abraham,</hi> Matth. 1.1. though there were <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen generations from Abraham to David,</hi> Matth. 1.17. If prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours ſo many deſcents removed be called Fathers; the grand-childe may be called by the grand-fathers name. The ſumme is, <hi>Abraham</hi> is not here the proper name of the Father of the faithfull; but it muſt be expounded of <hi>Jacob</hi> the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe of Abraham. For indeed <hi>Jacob</hi> the grand-childe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>bought the ground of the ſonnes of Hemor the father of Sychem,</hi> Joſh. 24.32. To confirm this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be more handſomely taken for his ſonnes ſonne <hi>Jacob,</hi> I found it in a margin-note of Druſius, <hi>Praeteritor. lib.</hi> 5. thus, <hi>Abraham, that is, the ſonne of Abraham:</hi> where he makes <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the father of Sychem.</hi> Thus much for the fourth couplet of Propoſitions, and the knitting up of that ſeeming oppoſition in a reall accordance, That Hemor or Hamor was the father of Sychem, as above all deniall is proved from Joſh. 24.32. though the Greek word uſed by S. Stephen be amphibolous. And now it is time to leave the ſeverall anſwers to each particular doubt, and to render the ſenſe of the words together.</p>
               <p n="5">5. One of theſe two wayes is (in my opinion) neceſſarie to be embraced:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the twelve Patriarchs the ſonnes of Jacob were carried out of Egypt into Sychem, and afterwards out of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem into the ſepulchre of Abraham: And then behold theſe three difficulties: Firſt, their father of whom Abraham bought the ground, muſt have two names. Secondly, it is hard and harſh to beleeve, that in the removall of the Patriarchs bones the Iſraelites would carrie them over to Sychem, and ſo paſſe by Hebron cloſe to the <hi>Abrahemium,</hi> or the cave where A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac, and Jacob, with their wives, were buried; and afterwards remove the bones back again from Sychem unto the ſepulchre which Abraham bought, which is ſixſcore miles (if not more) if we meaſure from Hebron to Sychem, and ſo backward from Sychem to Hebron. Calvarie and the citie of Jeruſalem lay almoſt even in the way from Goſhen to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, and from Sychem back to Hebron: And on Calvarie or there abouts, certainly they would have depoſed their bones, if they deſired the tranſlation of them to riſe with Chriſt. Thirdly, this expoſition implieth, ſince Joſeph was one of the Fathers, that Joſeph was alſo buried in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of Abraham; which is diſproved by Joſh. 24.32. And yet, that we may make this Expoſition paſſable and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let us conſider the anſwers. The firſt difficultie is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſaying, It is an uſuall thing in the Scripture for the ſame man to have two names; as Solomon is called <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> 2. Sam. 12.25. and the like. To the ſecond difficultie this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may be ſhaped, That though we could ſee no reaſon, nor could imagine any end, why they ſhould carrie and recarrie theſe bones; yet reaſons and juſt motives might then lead them, which we now may be ignorant of. But I take it as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Iſraelites ſooner and more quickly poſſeſſed the tribe of Ephraim, and the citie of Sychem (and therefore there might they leave their bones for a time) then Hebron
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6913:177"/>or Jeruſalem. For Joſhuah in his time called a Parliament or a Diet at Sychem, Joſh. 24.1. and the Ephraimites peaceably enjoyed their inheritance in Joſhuah his dayes, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites ſerved under tribute unto them, Joſh. 16.10. But after Joſhuah his death, they wan Jeruſalem and Hebron, Judg. 1.8, 10. and then they might recarry the bones of the Fathers to the <hi>Abrahemium</hi> by Hebron. The third knot is looſed, if we may ſay, that all the Fathers were carried into Abrahams cave, who had not a diſtinct buriall-place of their own, as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph had; who accordingly was not buried by Hebron, but by Sychem.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſecond way of expounding S. Stephen, according as the words lie in the Greek and Latine copies, is this; That the other Patriarchs the ſonnes of Jacob were buried by Sychem, as Joſeph was; and their bones brought up with his, when the Iſraelites came out of Egypt, and laid in the ſepulchre which Jacob the grandchilde of Abraham bought for a ſumme of money <hi>of the ſonnes of Hemor the father of Sychem,</hi> as is expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, Joſh. 24.32. Which latter way, for the accordance of words and names both in the Old and New Teſtament, I do moſt willingly embrace. For it repreſenteth not unto us ſo many or ſo great difficulties; yea none at all, ſince it was not ſo ſtrange that the word <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be a patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymick, and uſed for <hi>Jacob;</hi> eſpecially when Rehoboam is called <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>the ſonne of Jeſſe;</hi> and Abraham is ſaid to be <hi>the father of Levi,</hi> which Jacob was; and the Iſraelites are termed <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Pſal. 81.5. though moſt of them deſcended not from him; and they who aſcended out of Egypt, iſſued from Joſeph after divers generations. In two of which places moſt punctually, as well as here, the grandfathers names are put for the grandchildren. Eſpecially let this be throughly conſidered, that the grandchilde himſelf is diſtinctly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in other places of the divine ſtorie, to have bought the ſame ground of the ſonnes of Hemor, about Sychem, <hi>for an hundred pieces of money,</hi> Gen. 33.19. and the grandfather A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham not to have bought that, but an other piece of ground, at an other time, in an other place, for
<note n="*" place="margin">Geneſ. 23.16, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>foure hundred ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels of ſilver</hi> of Ephron the Hittite, neare Hebron, which was farre diſtant from Sychem. Which ſale of Ephron, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Abraham, is ratified by the witneſſe of truth, in the mouth of Jacob himſelf, and dying Jacob, Geneſ. 49.29, &amp;c. Therefore though the name of <hi>Abraham</hi> be read; it may be, it muſt be a patronymick; and <hi>Jacob</hi> is called by his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers name; and <hi>Jacob</hi> did what is aſcribed to <hi>Abraham:</hi> for other paſſages of Scripture do force us to expound it of Jacob.</p>
               <p>Thus have I digreſſed, to ſatisfie the great doubt which hath tortured the wits both of old and late Writers.</p>

I anſwer, The queſtion is not of what Chriſt <hi>could do,</hi> or <hi>can do;</hi> but what he <hi>did do,</hi> and what <hi>was done. A Poſſe ad Eſſe non valet argumentum.</hi> And if he imagineth that it impeacheth the power of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, unleſſe <hi>de facto</hi> the raiſed Saints be now alive in their bodies, (which is his intent;) any indifferent reader will ſay he is amiſſe, and ought not to ſquare the power of Chriſts reſurrection to his own fancie. Yea, but ſaith he, <hi>The whole fact will ſeem rather an apparition, then a true reſurrection.</hi> I anſwer, If he take <hi>apparition</hi> for a phantaſticall viſion, and meer imagination, or a deluſion of the ſenſes, his meaning is not to be ſuffered: yet in a good ſenſe and at large it may be called <hi>an apparition;</hi> for <hi>they appeared unto many,</hi> Matth. 27.53. A true apparition, and as true a reſurrection. A true reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of two ſorts: the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt;</hi> a <hi>good,</hi> and a <hi>better</hi> reſurrection: of which I ſpake before. One <hi>eternall:</hi> Such was Chriſts; <hi>Chriſt dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6.9. and, <hi>He hath the keyes of death,</hi> Revel. 1.18. yea, he alone was bleſſed with this reſurrection: hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhall; <hi>Every man in his own order. Chriſt the firſt-fruits, afterward they that are Chriſts, at his coming,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 15.23. The very time is expreſſed. S. Paul wrote this after Chriſts firſt coming; yea after his reſurrection many yeares: and therefore you muſt needs interpret it of his ſecond coming, as is moſt evident by the context: Therefore either
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6913:178"/>thoſe Saints are not Chriſts, or they ſhall ariſe at his laſt coming; and therefore have not riſen to an eternall reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The other true reſurrection is <hi>temporarie:</hi> Thus ſome were raiſed in the Old Teſtament, and ſome in the New: and though they died again, I dare not ſay their reſurrection was an apparition. And as out of doubt ſome of them who were raiſed by the Prophets, or by Chriſt in his life time, died ſooner then other: ſo if any of them had died within three or foure dayes, yea within an houre or two after that their reſurrection; yet had it not been an <hi>apparition</hi> onely, but a true <hi>temporary reſurrection.</hi> As, if a childe ſhould die the third inſtant after the ſouls infuſion, there were a true union, and a true death: ſo if one ſhould die again preſently after a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, there muſt needs be both a true reunion, reſurrection, and a ſecond death; God reuniting the ſoul, and again ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it, and diſpoſing of the creature without its wrong, to the glorie of the Creatour.</p>
               <p>If I be bold with Biſhop Bilſon, he is as bold with S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, and ſleighteth his reaſons, and croſſeth the very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Aquinas magnifieth, and which we have now in hand concerning David. All the Reverend Biſhops words are too large to be tranſcribed; you may reade them, pag. 217. and 218. I will onely ſingle out ſuch paſſages, as ſhew him to be ſingular or dubious in that point. <hi>That David is not aſcended into heaven, doth not hinder</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but David might be tranſlated into Paradiſe with the reſt of the Saints that roſe from the dead when Chriſt did: but it is a juſt probation, that Davids bodie was not then aſcended, when Chriſt ſat in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature at the right hand of God.</hi> Again he ſaith, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine hath ſome hold to prove that David did not aſcend in body when Chriſt did, or at leaſt not into heaven, whither Chriſt aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe in plain words Peter ſaith,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 2.34.</note> DAVID IS NOT ASCEND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED INTO HEAVEN. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>either the bodies of the Saints ſlept again, when they had given teſtimonie to Chriſts reſurrection: or they were placed in Paradiſe, and there expect the number of their brethren, which ſhall be raiſed out of the duſt: or laſtly, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was none of theſe that were raiſed to bear witneſſe of Chriſts reſurrection; but onely ſuch were choſen, as were known to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then living in Jeruſalem.</hi> So farre Biſhop Bilſon.</p>
               <p>Before I come to preſſe the argument, let me deſire the Reader to obſerve theſe things in the forecited words, and to cenſure accordingly. That the Saints may be in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> with their bodies, but not in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Is there any paradiſe but in heaven? and when S. Paul was in paradiſe, was he not in the third heaven? Shall the Saints that roſe upon Chriſts reſurrection, and (if they aſcended at all) aſcended upon his aſcenſion, Shall they (I ſay) be taken up from the earth,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6913:179"/>and not be glorified? or being glorified, not be with Chriſt? Shall they be kept at diſtance from the bleſſed ſpirits of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, that attend upon the Lambe; and hang between the earth and that heaven where their Redeemer reigneth? Secondly, againſt his former determination, and againſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which he brought to confirm it, he ſaith, <hi>Either the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints ſlept again,</hi> (But doth it not impeach the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſts reſurrection? or will it not ſeem an apparition, rather then a true reſurrection, as you before reaſoned?) <hi>or they were placed in Paradiſe, or David was none of thoſe who were raiſed to bear witneſſe of Chriſts reſurrection.</hi> You ſee now his reſolution is come down; but S. Auguſtines argument is ſound, that David was not excluded from that priviledge, which other ancient Fathers and Patriarchs enjoyed, if they enjoyed them. Biſhop Bilſon himſelf confeſſeth, that David aſcended not when Chriſt aſcended; but Chriſt ſat in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the right hand of God, when Davids bodie was not aſcended. If not then, when did he or they aſcend? or how were they witneſſes of his aſcenſion? Laſtly, that the Fathers before Chriſt were in bliſſe, is out of doubt: that they were in ſome manſion of heaven, is probable: that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and made happier by Chriſts exaltation, may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved: But that either the ſouls of the Patriarchs, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, are not with the other bleſſed Angels and ſpirits of men now where Chriſt is; or that the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and other moſt holy diſciples of Chriſt, do not follow the Lambe whereſoever he now is, but are in a paradiſe out of heaven; ſeems ſtrange divinitie, ſomewhat touching on the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Chiliaſts. But I leave Biſhop Bilſon, in this point unlike himſelf; he being a chief of our worthies, famous above thouſands for a moſt learned Prelate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if from the ground of S. Auguſtine, and the words of S. Peter, I do not demonſtrate that David roſe not to an eternall reſurrection; I am much deceived. The confeſſed ground of S. Auguſtine is, That it is hard and harſh to exclude David from being one that aroſe, if any aroſe, to eternall life: ſo that if David aroſe not, none may be thought of them ſo to ariſe, as to aſcend in their immortall bodies to heaven; ſince he had greater gifts or priviledges then ſome of them, and as great as almoſt any of them. But ſay I, David was none of thoſe that aroſe; or if he did, he aſcended not into heaven. And this I will undertake to prove by S. Peter. For firſt, S. Auguſtine in the ſame Epiſtle ſaith, The intent of S. Peter was to prove that theſe words, Pſal. 16.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my ſoul in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> were ſpoken of Chriſt onely, and not of David: and the Apoſtle evinceth it by this reaſon, Becauſe David did
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6913:179"/>die, and was buried, and <hi>his ſepulchre is with us,</hi> that is, his bones and his bodie, and his aſhes are yet with us: whereas if Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid had bodily aſcended, they would have fitted David as well as Chriſt; who died, and was buried, and his ſepulchre remained; but his bodie was not incinerated, neither was his fleſh corrupted, as Davids was, but aſcended: And ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles argument had been impertinent. Secondly, it is ſaid moſt remarkably, Act. 2.34. <hi>David is not aſcended into the heavens:</hi> But Chriſt is by Davids confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Note firſt the force of the <hi>Antitheſis.</hi> Secondly, obſerve that S. Peter ſpake this after Chriſts aſcenſion into heaven; whereas if any aroſe to incorruptible glorie, they aroſe or aſcended with Chriſt; and ſo, by juſt conſequent, before this time when S. Peter ſpake theſe words: yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He is not yet aſcended,</hi> or, <hi>He hath not aſcended into the heavens.</hi> Again, though David were in heaven in his ſoul long before that time, as we ſay; or if he went up out of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> as ſome Papiſts ſay: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſomeway he was not aſcended, when S. Peter thus preached. If any way he aſcended not, it muſt needs be in <hi>bodie</hi> or <hi>ſoul.</hi> They dare not ſay, He aſcended not in <hi>ſoul:</hi> and therefore we may boldly ſay, He aſcended not in <hi>bodie;</hi> unleſſe they will ſhew us ſome third nature in David that might aſcend, which thwarteth both Philoſophie and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, the Turks now inhabiting Jeruſalem keep the ſepulchre of David, forbidding entrance to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into it, as every traveller into thoſe parts knoweth; and they queſtionleſſe reſpect the ſepulchre, as containing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, bones, or aſhes of David there preſent and unremoved. Laſtly, if David aſcended not when Chriſt did, or a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is evidenced from the words of S. Peter; our enemies themſelves will not ſay that he aſcended long after, or of late: Therefore David is not aſcended bodily as yet, howſoever Pineda fancieth.</p>
               <closer>O Moſt mercifull Saviour, the ſonne of David, the Lord of David; who haſt ſupereminently the Key of David; and openeſt and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteſt and no man openeth: when in all contriteſt humilitie I caſt my ſelf down to the gates of hell, I beg, and call, and crie unto thee, that thou wouldeſt ſhut them; And open unto me (I beſeech thee) the gates of heaven, and lift up for me thoſe everlaſting doores, that I may come in to thee the King of glorie, and ſit at the feet of thy ſervants in thoſe celeſtiall manſions. Grant this, O moſt Bleſſed Jeſu, for thine own ſweet name ſake, and for the merit of thy death and paſsion. Amen.</closer>

Peters chain was not found till Auguſtine was dead:</hi> yet that learned Antiquarie could not be ignorant, that Baronius proveth, and proveth probably enough, the manner how it was kept by ſome of Herods miniſters, and ſo downward. But he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as I expound him candidly, It was not found in the Church as a publick relique. For <hi>it was not brought unto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, till Chryſoſtom was dead,</hi> ſaith Baronius, <hi>num.</hi> 5. And in the dayes of Proclus there was a tranſlation of thoſe two chains of S.

               <p n="5">5. I return from my digreſſion, and will make Bellarmine alſo ſhake his chains. Bellarmine, <hi>de reliq. Sanct.</hi> 2.3. tells out of S. Gregorie a ſtrange ſtorie of S. Pauls chains. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie promiſed to ſend unto Conſtantia the Empereſſe ſome of the filings of the chains of S. Paul, if at leaſt any part could be filed away: For the chains had this condition, that if a worthy partie deſired them, part of them would preſently be filed away; if the partie deſiring were unworthy, though one took great pains with all his ſtrength to file, yet he could file away nothing. A tough ſmith with a good file, would (in ſome mens judgement) confute this miracle.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Other Papiſts in other places do ſhew the prepuce of Chriſt, <hi>which, being a doubtfull thing, they worſhip more then whole Chriſt,</hi> ſaith Eraſmus. If one ſhould queſtion, How is Chriſt riſen? circumciſed, or uncircumciſed? perchance it would puzzle them.</p>
               <p>But why ſay I ſo? when Tolet on Luk. 2. gathereth from Titus Boſtrenus on the ſame place, <hi>Antiquam concertationem extitiſſe de praeputio Chriſti, That there was an old controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the prepuce of Chriſt.</hi> But I anſwer, That the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie on Luke aſcribed to Titus, is ſpurious and of latter times, as Bellarmine, <hi>de Scriptor.

Thirdly, both Titus and Theophylact ſay, That Chriſt reſumed the circumciſed part at his reſurrection. If they had but one authour of that antiquitie, that Chriſt left it on earth as a relique of his; how would they triumph? After this, Innocentius the third, ſomewhat above 400 yeares ſince, enquiring whether Chriſt did ariſe with his foreskin, ſaith, <hi>Some beleeve it to be kept at S.

               <p>I yet do queſtion, (if it were ſo) Who kept it till Brigets dayes? and, Which is the true prepuce? that at Rome? or that which Charles the great received from an Angel, and left in Germanie, not at Rome?

Pope Clement the ſeventh cauſed it to be ſearched for; yet it was not found. Thirty yeares after a Prieſt findes it, carrieth it to the land-ladie of the place: ſhe thrice trieth to untie the things wherewith it was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and thrice by a miracle is inhibited. Clarix a young virgin her daughter untieth all; and puts the prepuce firſt in a ſilver ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then in a ſilver casket: Thus it is placed in the Church of Calcata; then removed into the Chancel. Miracles are wrought. The Pope ſends Commiſsioners to ſearch the truth. One of the Prieſts, ere he was aware, tore the prepuce in two pieces;</hi> (Is it ſtill <hi>eadem numero membrana, the ſame numericall skinne,</hi> O learned Collius?) <hi>the Commiſsioners certifie it was the true relique of Chriſt; and it is kept at this day at Calcata, in the temple of S.

                  <hi>God ſpeed, O croſſe; do thou ſave us.</hi> Yet ſuch idolatrie Scharpius imputeth to the Papiſts.

I would not erect altars, temples, or appoint ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, or form a prayer to worſhip them; but to God for them. All theſe are derogatorie to the honour of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.</p>
               <p>If I were ſure to have help if I prayed unto a relique, I would not pray, and would refuſe that help. I would not dig up the bodie, or any part of the bodie of the greateſt Saint buried; unleſſe it were buried in unſeemly and unfit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: then would I not worſhip it, but tranſlate it to a decent ſepulchre. The bodies of the Patriarchs, Jacob and Joſeph, were not taken up to be kept as reliques, but to be tranſlated to their ſeverall ſepulchres: and David cauſed the bones of his deareſt Jonathan, when they had been carried from Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boah to the ſtreet of Beth-ſhan, from Beth-ſhan to Jabeſh-Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, to be buried in Zelah of Benjamin, in the ſepulchre of Kiſh, 2. Sam. 21.12, &amp;c. He kept them not for reliques, nor worſhipped them.</p>
               <p>I would not give ſo much reverence to any relique, as I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6913:184"/>would to the Saint himſelf, if I were divinely aſcertained that the Saints ſoul preſented it ſelf in a ſhape unto me: and yet I would not fall down to worſhip that Saint; and ſhould I to his relique?

               <p>I would not ſay or think, that any relique or reliques have in themſelves, or from themſelves power to expell devils, or to work wonders: for <hi>a ſpirituall power</hi> (as Thyraeus well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, though it wound himſelf) <hi>is not within a thing corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall: and a bodily power cannot drive away devils;</hi> or, work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſay I. The great works of healing, &amp;c. which have been done at the tombes of Martyrs, (reade S. Auguſtine <hi>de civitat.

<note n="l" place="margin">Suſcipientes perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Martyrum.</note> 
                  <hi>in aſſumed bodies like to the Martyrs,</hi> as Auguſtine phraſeth it, <hi>in lib. de cura pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis gerenda, cap.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>The reliques have no vertue in themſelves, to effectuate or actuate ſuch miracles: yea, the very Angels or Martyrs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were but the agents, inſtruments, and the right hand of the Almighty, who onely worketh great wonders by his power independent.</p>
               <p>I would put no truſt, no confidence in the relique of any Saint or Martyr whoſoever, or whatſoever, for help either of ſoul or bodie: For this alſo is a wrong offered unto him in whoſe name our help ſtandeth: <hi>Our help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth,</hi> Pſal. 121.2.

If any inſtrument of Satan ſhould debaſe it, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6913:185"/>ſay that it is <hi>viliſsimus pulvis;</hi> I would ſcorn his ſcorn, and eſteem it as a moſt eſpeciall inſtrument of the moſt High; and would ſay to the caviller, or rather to his maſter Lucifer the Father of lies and detraction,

                  <hi>Even this which thou calleſt moſt vile duſt, hath often tormented thee,</hi> as S. Hierom ſaid of old. Laſtly, till of it ſelf it decayed, and by its imperfection or rottenneſſe called for interment, I would not bury it: but commend it to be kept even in Churches and other holy places; except idolatrie were committed with it, or people in their profane religion adored it: And then would I alſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F ſtill you preſſe the queſtion, <hi>Who thoſe</hi> MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY <hi>were?</hi> or, <hi>Who were ſome of thoſe</hi> MANY? I anſwer with Lorinus, that <hi>part of truth lieth hid and covered.</hi> Amongſt conjectures, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this mine own as probable. Firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, That none of the ancient Patriarchs, Prophets, or Types of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, aroſe: for if one; Who is he? and why not others as well as he? and if they had riſen, Who ſhould have known them? or how could they induce the then living to beleeve that they were the ſame Patriarchs or Prophets? They might have been as well thought to have been incarnate ſpirits: for the evil ſpirits al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo kept about the tombes and graves of the deceaſed: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you will multiply miracles upon miracles; and ſay, God by miracle did reveal theſe to be true Patriarchs. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could not prove it to thoſe who lived 2000 yeares after them. And if there had been ſuch miracles, the Evangeliſts would not have ſlipt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea, but S. Peter knew Moſes and Elias at Chriſts transfiguration, though they were taken away from among men long before: And therefore the then living might know the dead Patriarchs and holy men raiſed, though they died long before. I anſwer, That S. Peter, and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles James and John, might know by the conference between Chriſt and Moſes and Elias, who they were: Whereas Chriſt never converſed or conferred with thoſe that were raiſed, for ought that is recorded, or probably to be maintained. And
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6913:188"/>it is a figment to ſay or imagine, that there was any third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which knew both the then raiſed on the one ſide, and the living which never had been dead on the other ſide; or could give aſſurance that the raiſed were ſuch and ſuch Patriarchs and Fathers. Nor were their teſtimonies to be taken one for another, ſince the deniall or doubt concerning any one, draweth in the deniall or doubt of all the reſt: and upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of one falſe apparition, any one and every one of the reſt might be queſtioned. Secondly, S. Peter and S. John might know Moſes and Elias by divine revelation, which to them was not unfrequent: as Chriſts Divinitie was revealed to Peter, Matth. 16.17. and Ananias his heart, Act. 5.3, &amp;c. or as Luke knew by the Spirit that Peter wept bitterly, though Peter wept ſecretly: for he went out firſt, Luk. 22.62. and what he went out purpoſely to conceal, ſhall we think that he did purpoſely reveal? Now though the Apoſtles had ſupernall illumination guiding them into all truth; yet that by divine revelation extraordinary every one of them then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at Jeruſalem knew every one of them who were raiſed and appeared unto them, is, unneceſſarily to multiply many miracles. Now ſince <hi>they</hi> knew not the perſons of the raiſed by Chriſt, nor any other <hi>third perſon,</hi> nor by <hi>heavenly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> they could no way know the raiſed Patriarchs, unleſſe by their pictures or ſtatues: which of all other wayes is moſt unprobable, as being a courſe not practiſed in thoſe times and places.</p>
               <p>The argument now hath received its anſwer. Peter might many wayes, and did ſome way know Moſes and Elias: and yet I finde not any way whereby the inhabitants of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly citie could perſonally know the Patriarchs and Fathers, being before buried and incinerated: And therefore I proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, Not any one of theſe were raiſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, my poſitive probable conjecture is this, (which alſo ſeemeth more likely to Lucas Brugenſis) That many of thoſe Saints who lived in Chriſts time, and beleeved in him; whoſe memorie was freſh, and whoſe children, kindred, or acquaintance were yet living, and who were known to adhere to Chriſt (and to this opinion Biſhop Bilſon ſeemeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to encline) Many (I ſay) of thoſe dead Saints now aroſe, and appeared unto many: as, it may be, John the Baptiſt (though the deceitfull miracle-mongers ſhew the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of that good Saints head in divers places) and Zacharie and Eliſabeth his parents; and thoſe many, Luk. 1.66. and thoſe ſhepherds, Luk. 2.8. and thoſe wonderers, to whom the ſhepherds told our Saviours nativitie, Luk. 2.18. perhaps ſome would adde thoſe wiſemen, who came to worſhip Chriſt, Matth. 2.2. and old Simeon, and Anna the Propheteſſe, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6913:188"/>Joſeph Chriſts reputed father (though ſome think that Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph lived after Chriſts reſurrection: and yet others ſay, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the twelfth yeare of Chriſts age; to whom Baronius ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclineth:
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad annum Chriſti</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſeph being very aged, about</hi> 80 <hi>yeares old, when he was eſpouſed to the holieſt Virgin,</hi> as Epiphanius and others do gueſſe. For my part, I embrace the mean, and tread in the middle path: Neither thinking that Joſeph died the 12 yeare; for when Chriſt was twelve yeares old, Joſeph went up to Jeruſalem, Luk 2.42. and after Chriſts deſcent to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, Chriſt was obedient to Joſeph and the all-garacious Virgin, verſ. 51. therefore Joſeph could not be dead in the twelfth yeare of Chriſt; which the learned Baronius did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely and ſluggiſhly paſſe over, and not obſerve: Nor yet do I imagine on the other ſide, that he lived beyond Chriſts reſurrection, or till his death; ſince there is frequent mention of Chriſts Apoſtles, of his holy mother, and of his couſins, and friends, men and women, yea of ſtrangers; and no mention, nor intimation at all,
<note place="margin">See Salianus in his Annals <hi>in annum mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> 4065, at large on this point.</note> that Joſeph lived till Chriſt began publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preach, and do miracles; much leſſe after his death. So upon my ſuppoſall that he died between the thirteenth yeare of Chriſt and the twentie ninth, Joſeph might very well be one of thoſe who were raiſed at that time) and with him (perhaps) divers, whom Chriſt had healed, or to whom he had preached (if they died before) and many others, with whom Chriſt converſed till he was thirty yeares old.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And all theſe did prove and confirm unto the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or wavering Saints, their friends or kindred, yea and to the very beleevers alſo, the truth of Chriſts doctrine, of his death, of his reſurrection: appearing not promiſcuouſly to Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians or to Romans, not to all, no not to all the Jews; but <hi>to many;</hi> but <hi>to fit perſons,</hi> ſaith the Interlinearie Gloſſe, <hi>whether Jews, Grecians, or Romans then reſiding at Jeruſalem;</hi> to ſuch as knew them in their lives, and at their deaths. This conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may paſſe the more plauſibly, if we conſider that Chriſt himſelf appeared not to all indifferently, but onely to ſome, and to ſome oftner times then to others: yet no where is ſaid to have ſhewed himſelf to any, but onely to his followers and Diſciples. And as the Apoſtles were confirmed by Chriſts holy conference; ſo might many other then living beleeve, or the rather beleeve the Goſpel of Chriſt upon proof made by the new raiſed, in many particulars ſtrengthning their faith. They aroſe,

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat theſe raiſed Saints, who bare witneſſe of Chriſt, ſetling many pendulous and doubting ſouls, ſtrengthening many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and Diſciples of our Saviour, and (perhaps) converting ſome unbeleevers, by teaching them that their expected Meſſiah was now come, that he did live among them, and had died for their ſinnes, and riſen again for their juſtification; That they (I ſay) after this office per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, again depoſited their bodies in the earth, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not corporally into heaven, you may behold proved by this firſt reaſon, drawn from Scripture. For Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the high Prieſt, who <hi>alone entred the</hi> SANCTUM SANCTORUM, Hebr. 9.7. It is true indeed, that we <hi>enter into the Holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus,</hi> Heb. 10.19. but he onely,
<note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 10.10.</note> 
                  <hi>by a new and living way, through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh,
<note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 9.12.</note> entred in once into the holy place.</hi> His entring differing from others entring; and differing in this, That with his bodie he entred, others aſcended not into heaven with him bodily. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if they had aſcended into heaven, following Chriſt; their bodies muſt have been ſeen as well as Chriſts: But their bodies were not ſeen aſcending; for the Evangeliſts would not have omitted a matter of ſuch moment. Suarez denieth this, becauſe the Evangeliſts do deſcribe ſuch things as may be ſeen with bodily eyes, in which regard, neither the Angels, nor the ſouls of Saints are reported to have accompanied him, which yet divers beleeve to have kept wing and way with him to heaven. I anſwer, Though Angels and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men be not ſpecified, as not being ſeen, as not being
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6913:190"/>to be ſeen without bodies; yet ſuch Saints as aroſe with their bodies, and went into heaven with their bodies (as Suarez and others think all they who aroſe out of their graves did) might in likelihood be ſeen aſcending with Chriſt, as well as Chriſts bodie. And their bodies were as ſubject to be ſeen with bodily eyes, as Chriſts was; yea, more viſible, by how much Chriſts bodie was more glorified then any of the Saints; if claritie, impaſſibilitie, agilitie, and ſubtilitie do make glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodies to be leſſe viſible: all which Chriſt had in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree above any other. An unglorified eye can ſee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a glorified bodie: though a glorified bodie can be ſeen or not ſeen, according as it pleaſeth. See the Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Aquin, part 3. queſt. 85. artic. 2.3. Therefore my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is firm, as his objection is impertinent. Thirdly, from Epiphanius in Ancorato, I gathered what before I onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, That ſuch onely were raiſed as died a while before, who riſing were known to ſuch as then lived, that their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie might, by their former familiaritie, the rather be beleeved, and be void of exception; whereas if ſuch were raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as died long before, they muſt firſt uſe arguments to prove that themſelues had ſometimes lived, and that they once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they were newly raiſed, and that they were the ſame perſons whom they reported themſelves to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, that theſe ſhould go into eternall happineſſe both of ſouls and bodies, and leave the Patriarchs bodies in the duſt, is in judgement improbable. Therefore if it were to be proved, that thoſe who aroſe out of their graves after or upon Chriſts Paſſion, did aſcend into the moſt glorious hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in heaven, both of bodie and ſoul: as, above other men, I ſhould think and maintain, that Adam, Seth, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and all the reſt before mentioned, and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, holy Prophets and others, were they that did ariſe, and were they who were partakers with Chriſt of perfect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, and had more favours and priviledges then other men: So ſince Epiphanius concludeth, That others of later times were raiſed; I will be bold to inferre, that others aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not into heaven before thoſe holy Patriarchs, but laid their bodies in the graves again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, if the end of their reſurrection mho now aroſe, was to teſtifie that Chriſt was riſen; this dutie they might fulfill, though they aſcended not into heaven with him. If to teſtifie that Jeſus was <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> that he was <hi>juſt,</hi> that he was <hi>the Sonne of God</hi> (which was the collection of the Centurion, when he ſaw the graves open, and that many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies aroſe, Matth. 27.54.) their aſcenſion into heaven was not neceſſary to that certificate. If they ſay, They aroſe to be witneſſes of his aſcenſion into heaven: I anſwer, He had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6913:190"/>other witneſſes of it, Act. 1.9. who would have been witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their aſcenſion alſo, if they had aſcended with him. If you ſay, they aroſe to be companions of his aſcenſion; I reply, that you do but beg the queſtion, and hold a groundleſſe concluſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, <hi>Chriſt was ſeen of the Apoſtles fourtie dayes, and ſpake of things pertaining to the Kingdome of God,</hi> Act. 1.3. and <hi>He ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſsion, by many infallible proofs,</hi> as is ſaid immediately before: and they ſaw, when he aſcended into heaven, verſ. 9. But that Chriſt ever converſed with any of thoſe that were raiſed; or was ſeen with them; or they with him; or they with the Apoſtles, or Diſciples; or that any aſcended into heaven, is no direct mention; as perhaps there would, if Adam and the reſt of the holy Patriarchs and Prophets had been raiſed, and had gone into heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither would Chriſt, who vouchſafed Peter, James, and John, to ſee him conferre with Moſes and Elias at the Transfiguration, have now denied Peter, James, and John, to ſee him conferre with the ſame Moſes and other Patriarchs after his reſurrection, if they had aroſe and conferred with him, as out of doubt, during the time of fourtie dayes that he converſed on earth, ſince their and his reſurrection (if they aroſe) he often diſcourſed with them: for he did but about twelve times appeare to the Apoſtles, and that moſt on the Sabbath-dayes and then ſtayed not very long with them: and ſo I may probably think that he did imploy ſome part of the reſt of the time from his reſurrection to his aſcenſion, in conference with Moſes and the Patriarchs raiſed; eſpecially if they were to aſcend bodily into heaven with him: But none of theſe things are once pointed at: Therefore there is no likelihood that they were raiſed, much leſſe that they aſcended with Chriſt into heaven.</p>

And Albericus Gentilis moſt exquiſitely diſputeth in defence of the firſt book of Maccabees (ſo little regarded in theſe times) and anſwereth every objection which is brought againſt it. I could ſay more in defence of other books Apocryphall; but I recall my ſelf to handle that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which cauſed this diverſion. How many wide mouths have been made? how many ſcandalls taken? how many aſperſions of horrible untruth and lying have been faſtened on that bleſſed Angel who guided Tobias the younger in his long and dangerous journey, becauſe he ſaid, (though he gave old Tobit a nick, for that he would enquire his name,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6913:192"/>immediately after) Tob. 5.12. <hi>I am Azarias, the ſonne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias the Great, and of thy brethren;</hi> whereas you may expound the words by this rule, That he who ſuſtains anothers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may call himſelf, or be called according as the perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. As the Angel, who appeared to S. John, Rev. 22.9. ſaying, <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy brethren the Prophets;</hi> and, perhaps, took one of their ſhapes at that time. Likewiſe in the undoubted Canonicall, the Angel Gabriel is called <hi>The man Gabriel,</hi> Dan. 9.21. becauſe he appeared in the ſimilitude of a man. Thus may the place of Tobit be expounded: and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch favourable interpretations, <hi>Familiaris &amp; quotidianus ſermo non cohaerebit,</hi> ſaith Cicero, <hi>Pro A. Caecinna.</hi> Secondly, you may expound the words thus, I AM AZARIAS, that is, <hi>the help of God:</hi> THE SONNE OF ANANIAS THE GREAT; NOW ANANIAS ſignifieth <hi>the grace,</hi> or <hi>the gift of God.</hi> And this is verified by the actions of the Angel, who helped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both the Tobiahs, by the eſpeciall <hi>grace of God.</hi> Adde to this, that the Angels true name was <hi>Raphael,</hi> Tob. 12.15. which is by ſignification, <hi>the medicine,</hi> or <hi>phyſick of God:</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did make whole young Tobie his wife, and healed alſo old Tobie, Tob. 12.3. All which being laid together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all inconvenience from the words, if we ſay, The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel by thoſe names of men, <hi>Azarias</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> did ſignifie, that the help which was to come from him to them, came to him from God. For even this way draweth nigh unto that <hi>Lexicall expoſition,</hi> as

               <p>Secondly I anſwer, If theſe were no Angels, but very men; and theſe ſome of thoſe <hi>Many</hi> who aroſe out of their ſepulchres: yet cleare it is, they aſcended not with Chriſt, nor aſcended they at all, for ought that can be gathered; but upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this their laſt errand, their bodies might again embrace the duſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, this may have a place of a probable argument: As Elias, when he was rapt into heaven in a fiery chariot, by a whirlwinde, (being even therein a type of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) let fall his mantle from him, 2. King. 2.13. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance as a token that he needed it no more: ſo Chriſt, when he raiſed himſelf, left his grave-linen in the grave, the linen clothes by themſelves, the napkin that was about his head wrapped together in a place by it ſelf, John 20.7. out of doubt, to ſhew that death ſhould have no more dominion over him. In which regard alſo he aroſe, the tombe being ſhut, and the tombe-ſtone ſealed, and obſerved narrowly with a watch: for the removing of the tombe-ſtone by the Angel, was not to help Chriſt to ariſe, who entred in to his diſciples, <hi>januis clauſis, the doores being ſhut,</hi> and came forth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6913:192"/>of the grave, <hi>ſepulchro ſignato, the monument being ſealed:</hi> but that the women might go in, and ſee that Chriſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raiſed, Mark 16.3. &amp;c. (and <hi>the ſtone was not rolled away propter Chriſtum, ſed propter mulieres, for Chriſt, but for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> ſaith Hierom <hi>ad Hedibiam)</hi> whereas contrarily, when La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus was raiſed, the tombe-ſtone was firſt removed, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus aroſe, tied with the grave-clothes; and <hi>his face bound with a napkin:</hi> yea, <hi>came forth bound hand and foot with grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes,</hi> Joh. 11.44. by a new miracle, walking being bound, and bound with grave-clothes; to ſhew, that though he did live, he did live to die again. In which reſpect alſo, perhaps, the graves were opened at Chriſts paſſion, when he yeelded up the ghoſt; and continued open till his reſurrection (yea, till the ends of their riſing were fulfilled:) and after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the graves,</hi> Matth. 27.52, 53.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe laſt cited words of Matth. 27.53. being differently pointed, will bear a double and different interpretation. Our late Tranſlation hath it thus, <hi>The Saints came out of the graves after his reſurrection,</hi> (there is one pauſe) <hi>and went into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly citie,</hi> (there is another pauſe:) ſo is it in the Vulgat, and in moſt Greek copies. This ſenſe in thoſe words is involved, That the Saints aroſe not till Chriſt aroſe, and that their reſurrection was a little after, or almoſt contemporary with Chriſts: which alſo is evidently foretold, Iſaiah 26.19. (if the prophet propheſieth there of Chriſt, or ſpeaketh in Chriſts perſon) <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my dead bodie ſhall they ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> For Chriſts bodie ariſeth not from the earth at the generall reſurrection; and therefore they punctually ſigne out the reſurrection of other Saints with Chriſt, and with his dead bodie. But if Iſaiah ſpeaketh of his own reſurrection, and not of Chriſts; nor in Chriſts perſon, but in his own: by theſe words and the words following he pointeth out the generall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo Vatablus, Hierom and Lyra expound the place. Now, if he point at the laſt day of the world, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is demonſtrative, that either Iſaiah aroſe not with Chriſt (though he was the moſt Evangelicall Prophet, and in no likelihood to be ſecluded from thoſe benefits, which other Prophets are ſaid to enjoy:) or if he aroſe, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to riſe with others at the day of judgement; which they who aſcended bodily into heaven, did not: Therefore Iſaiah is not bodily aſcended into heaven; and if not he, why others?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond way of pointing that place of S. Matthew, is this; <hi>Many bodies of the Saints aroſe:</hi> (there is one Colon) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and coming out of the graves after his reſurrection went into the holy citie.</hi> there is the full period, and no other pointing of the words. And thus it is read in the edition printed at Geneva by John Vignon, 1615. and illuſtrated with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon his notes: but I take it, that a pauſe ſhould be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6913:193"/>after the word <hi>Graves:</hi> and then they might ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt; but not enter into the holy citie till after his reſurrection. I am ſure, the Syriack, tranſlated by Tremellius, thus readeth and pointeth it; and Lucas Brugenſis diſliketh it not;
<note n="a" place="margin">Et egreſſi ſunt, &amp; poſt reſurrectionem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus ingreſſi ſunt in urbem ſanctam.</note> 
                  <hi>And they came forth, and after his reſurrection went into the holy citie.</hi> In the Syriack you have theſe ſteps, <hi>Obdormierant; ſurrexerunt; egreſsi ſunt; &amp; poſt reſurrectionem ejus ingreſsi ſunt in urbem.</hi> From which ſecond reading the reſultance is, That thoſe Saints aroſe before Chriſt aroſe. Neither is it againſt reaſon: for at Chriſts paſsion <hi>the graves were opened,</hi> verſ. 52. Shall the graves be opened, and nothing be raiſed? No: for it is added immediately, <hi>Many bodies of Saints were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Shall the bodies be raiſed; and either lie down, or ſit ſtill in the graves? To what end? <hi>Many bodies aroſe of the Saints, which</hi> HAD SLEPT; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is in the preterperfect tenſe; Now were they waked, now were they raiſed, now went they forth out of their monuments: and between the time of Chriſts paſsion and his reſurrection, perhaps, the raiſed conferred with themſelves; perchance, they communed with others without the citie; or, being rapt with divine ſpeculations, might either on mount Olivet, or rather on mount Calvarie, ſpend that time in ſolitary devotions, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the triumphant return of their captain Jeſus Chriſt from hell and the grave; and after his reſurrection they came into the holy citie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſumme is, Theſe reliving Saints aroſe at Chriſts paſsion, and before him; but none ever aroſe before him unto an eternall reſurrection: for in that regard Chriſt was <hi>the firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> 1. Corin. 15.20. and it is Chriſts pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, which the Apoſtle toucheth at, Rom. 6.9. <hi>That Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him:</hi> (of which hereafter, though I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it alſo before) Death had power over others, who were raiſed before him: Therefore they aſcended not into heaven with their bodies; nor were partakers of the eternall incorruption and immortalitie. Let me adde, That as the ſepulchres were opened, that they might come forth; and continued open till the reſurrection, and perhaps after: ſo in that they were opened to their hand, and did not ſhut again, I take it as a figure, that they did (as it were) expect the return of their bodies; and as a probable argument, that they did lie down again in their old repoſitories, or dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. And that you may the ſooner give credit unto this, in the next place conſider the generall law, That all of us ſhall have glorie and immortalitie together; for Hebr. 11.40. <hi>God hath prepared a better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> If you expound this of the Fathers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6913:194"/>of the Old Teſtament, and of the <hi>ſtola animae, the robe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the minde;</hi> yet you ſhall finde Revel. 6.11, that in regard even of <hi>ſtola corporis, the glorious garment of the bodie,</hi> the Saints themſelves are commanded to <hi>reſt yet for a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, untill their fellow-ſervants alſo, and their brethren</hi> (either then alive, or perchance not then born) <hi>that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now againſt this generall rule you muſt not make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exception, without expreſſe warrant from the word of God: But there is no teſtimony at all from the word of God, either direct or inferentiall, that any of thoſe <hi>Many</hi> who aroſe, aroſe to glorie or immortalitie, or aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Therefore we may boldly conclude, They died again. This argument is of ſuch force, that Suarez leaveth it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, and untouched. Laſtly, if the bodies of theſe Saints aſcended into heaven; either they aſcended after Chriſt, or before him, or with him. If after him; When and how long after? and why after him? They aſcended not preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: for the Apoſtles who looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven, even after he was taken out of their ſight, might have then perceived their bodily aſcent. If you ſay, So ſoon as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles left their ſerious viewing, and hearkened unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, then they aſcended: I anſwer; I would ſay ſo alſo, if I ſaw any proof, or if I could think that God ſent the Angels juſt at that moment, to hinder the Apoſtles from ſeeing the Saints mount up to heaven, which would have been ſo joyous a ſight. Briefly, there is no reaſon to ſay they aſcended long after Chriſt aſcended; and certainly leſſe reaſon is there to think they aſcended before him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, Chriſt as man ſhall be Judge at the laſt day: and God hath given aſſurance of it to all men, <hi>in that he hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> Act. 17.31. If any other were raiſed up in the ſame manner before him, or with him, to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſurrection; what aſſurance doth God give by this place of S. Paul, that Chriſt ſhall be the Judge, rather then others? But indeed the raiſing of Chriſt was more then ordinary, was more then temporarie: Let him have the preeminence in all things: <hi>Chriſt is the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.20. <hi>The firſt-fruits of them that are raiſed,</hi> verſ. 23. He is <hi>Primitiae mortuorum,</hi> Revel. 1.5. <hi>&amp; reſurgentium,</hi> Act. 26.23. Chriſt is the firſt who ſhall ariſe from the dead, <hi>viz.</hi> to an eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: his bodie opening, as it were, the gates of heaven for our bodies; which if Enoch and Elias did by priviledge eſpeciall anticipate (though theſe were not properly raiſed, but rather taken up;) yet, if more, if ſo many ſhould before him ariſe to an everlaſting reſurrection; it deſtroyeth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a generall rule.
<note n="b" place="margin">Gratia quae omnibus datur, non eſt gratia, ſed natura; &amp; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium gaudet paucita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace given alike to all, is no longer
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6913:194"/>grace but nature: and a priviledge is properly confined to a few.</hi> That they aſcended not with Chriſt, I proved before: and for a Corollarie do repeat this, That if aſſumed and Angelicall bodies were to be ſeen, and were ſeen and heard at Chriſts aſcenſion; out of doubt the bodies of Saints had been viſible, yea ſeen, if they had then aſcended.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If any deſire to ſee more reaſons, let him reade S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, <hi>Epiſt. 99. ad Euodium; &amp; de Mirabilibus Sacrae Scripturae;</hi> whoſe reaſons

               <p>You may now perceive that I am gently fallen upon the ſecond head; in vertue of which I undertook to prove, That the Saints, who miraculouſly aroſe, and here aroſe, did not aſcend into heaven, but died again: for the ſecond head, was Authoritie. Among Authours you have alreadie two of the chiefeſt for depth of learning, Auguſtine and Aquinas. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom is of their minde, on Matth. 27.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus having beaten down the oppoſite au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities (if they were fully on that ſide) with weight and number; the third and laſt point, which I propounded to handle, was the anſwering of all their reaſons and arguments. Some are ſo weak, that I need not to anſwer. For Suarez himſelf, who alledgeth them, confeſſeth their weakneſſe, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. Theſe three proofs following he alledgeth; but anſwereth not. Firſt, <hi>It was decent and behovefull,</hi> DECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IT (ſaith Suarez) <hi>that Chriſt, who had both bodie and ſoul, ſhould have companions of his glory, in their bodies as well as in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6913:195"/>their ſouls: For his delight is to be with the children of men,</hi> Proverb. 8.31. Which Suarez (it may be) took as an hint from Cajetan: for he, on Aquin. <hi>parte primâ, quaeſt.</hi> 53. <hi>art.</hi> 3. hath it thus,
<note n="a" place="margin">Rationale videtur, quòd ſucrexerint per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectè ad vitam penitus immortalem; ut beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo corporis in Chriſto haberet ſocios: minus enim corporalis feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas aliquid habere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deretur, it deſit corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis ſocietas: eſt enim homo ſecundùm vitam corporcam animal ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciale, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>It ſtandeth with reaſon, that they aroſe perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a life fully immortall, that the bodily bleſſedneſſe of Chriſt might have ſome fellows: For the bodily happineſſe ſeems not perfect and compleat, if bodily ſocietie and company be wanting: for man is, according to the corporeall life, a ſociable creature,</hi> or <hi>good fellow: not onely for want of neceſſaries unto life, as happeneth in this world; but for naturall delight, conſiſting in bodily converſation,</hi> ſaith Cajetan, diſſenting in this from the great Summiſt his maſter. I anſwer, that Cajetans argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ridiculous: for it holdeth chiefly in children, or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, in fools and in ſtriplings, who love play-mates; or in worldly factours, whom buſineſſe forceth into ſocietie and commerce. But that the Saints in heaven, yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the all bleſſed Saviour of the world, both God and Man, ſhould not have the full of delight, or have too little of bodily felicity, if other humane bodies be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſavoureth rather of the Turkiſh Coran and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian ſchool, then of the ſacred Text: and that Chriſt in heaven, is <hi>animal ſociale,</hi> naturally delighting in bodily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation (for ſo much the application of that Axiom im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, or els he ſaith nothing to the purpoſe) doth imply his brutiſh conceit of our moſt holy Redeemer. The ſweet ſinger of Iſrael ſaith, Pſal. 16.11. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſſe of joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> If this befall other holy Saints; much more it belongeth to Chriſt, from whoſe fulneſſe all the whole bodie of his Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth comfortable influences. But grant we, that ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily companie might be deſired by Chriſt: yet he needed not theſe <hi>Many;</hi> but he might have had Enoch and Elias, or Moſes and Elias, with whom he conferred at his tranſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, unto Suarez his words Barradas his fellow-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite anſwereth, Chriſt needeth not men indued with bodies now in heaven. As for the place of the Proverbs, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent words give light unto them, <hi>I rejoyced in the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of the earth,</hi> ſaith the Text: So his delights were with the ſonnes of men in and upon the earth: but of his delight in them with their humane bodies in heaven Before the laſt reſurrection, there is no inkling or intimation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Suarez argueth thus ſecondly,
<note n="b" place="margin">Animae glorioſae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturale eſt, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>It is very naturall for a glorified ſoul to be united unto an immortall and glorious bodie: But their ſouls were glorious: Therefore their bodies alſo: And the glorie of a bleſſed ſoul, of its own nature redounds upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> I anſwer, It doth ſo naturally, if it be not hindered. But
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6913:196"/>the bleſſed ſouls of theſe <hi>Many Saints</hi> were in bodies, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, not bleſſed, not glorious, for a few dayes or houres, and that <hi>by miracle,</hi> ſaith Barradius.</p>
               <p>Beſides, whileſt Chriſt lived on earth, unleſſe at his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, or ſome ſuch eſpeciall occaſion, the glorie of his moſt happie ſoul, which was then beatified as much as any of the ſouls of the Saints are now, and more, did not impart viſible glorie to his bodie: but it was paſſible and mortall; for it died. Then why may not theſe Saints have the glorious light of their ſouls eclipſed from their bodies?</p>
               <p>Again, the aſſumed bodies of bleſſed Angels ever did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into their firſt principles, when the ends why they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them, were fulfilled: the like might be in the Saints, whoſe ſouls were hindered from communicating incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and glorious qualities to their bodies; and ſo they were partakers not of the perfection of the laſt eternall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of the imperfections incident to the temporarie and mortall reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſaith Suarez, <hi>Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, are in hell with their bodies: therefore ſome, to ſhew Gods mercie, muſt now be in heaven with their bodies: and therefore theſe Many.</hi> I anſwer, that both the ſequences are lame, though we ſhould grant the ground or antecedent of the Argument. For firſt, was not Gods mercie ſeen in heaven, from the houre of Corah and his companies deſcent into hell, till theſe <hi>Many</hi> aſcended? Then why may it not ſtill be ſeen, though theſe aſcended not? eſpecially, ſince that Chriſt is there in a moſt bleſſed incorruptible bodie, as they are in hell in curſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which would take corruption for a favour. Laſtly, why muſt theſe <hi>Many Saints</hi> be the counter-pattern in heaven, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Enoch, or Elias, or Moſes, being the Magiſtrate againſt whom Corah and his complices combined themſelves?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others there are who object, <hi>It is ſaid,</hi> THEY ENTRED INTO THE HOLY CITIE: <hi>But the holy citie is the new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Jeruſalem above, Revel.</hi> 21.2. <hi>Therefore they died not, but went into heaven.</hi> I anſwer, Jeruſalem below, the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Jeruſalem, the ſeat of the kings of Judah, becauſe of Gods worſhip there eſpecially to be performed in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temple, was alſo called <hi>the holy citie.</hi> GLORIOUS THINGS ARE SPOKEN OF THEE, THOU CITIE OF GOD, Pſal. 87.3.

               <p>May I annex to this, That, if the whole land of Jurie be to this day called <hi>The holy Land,</hi> nor will have other eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of divers Nations, in ſome regards, till the worlds end: then certainly the Metropoliticall citie thereof, the famous and eminent Jeruſalem, might in thoſe dayes be dignified with the title of <hi>The holy citie,</hi> for many juſt regardable cauſes.</p>
               <p>Again, when it is ſaid, Act. 6.13. <hi>This man ceaſeth not to ſpeak blaſphemous words againſt this holy place;</hi> they that ſaid ſo, were not in the <hi>Temple;</hi> but in their <hi>Councel-houſe</hi> in <hi>the citie:</hi> and the words have a true reference to the <hi>citie,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Temple;</hi> yea more, becauſe the Temple was within the citie, and not <hi>è contrá.</hi> Now their Councel-houſe was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a good way from any part of the Temple, and was built cloſe by one wall of the citie; and was called GASITH in Hebrew; wherein ſeventie Senatours, or ordinarie Judges, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led SANHEDRIM, determined weighty cauſes: and here they examined the Apoſtles, Acts 4.7. and S. Stephen, Act. 6.13. and 7.1.</p>
               <p>The citie which before was called <hi>Solyma,</hi> was by Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech named <hi>Hieroſolyma,</hi> that is, <hi>The holy Solyma,</hi> ſaith Joſephus, <hi>de bello Judaico.</hi> 7.18. Let Joſephus juſtifie upon what grounds he mongrelleth the name: for, neither did Melchizedech ſpeak Greek; nor doth the Hebrew incline to that ſenſe: yet is even that hotch-potch better to be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the impious and ſottiſh fable of other Jews, That Melchizedech having named the citie <hi>Salem,</hi> and Abraham having called the mount Moriah in or about Jeruſalem, JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VA JIREH, <hi>The Lord will ſee,</hi> or <hi>provide,</hi> Geneſ. 22.14: God

               </p>
               <p>Perhaps, S. Hierom can hardly prove what he ſaith in his epiſtle to Dardanus, <hi>de Terra promiſsionis Tom.</hi> 3.24. that the citie was firſt called <hi>Jebus;</hi> and thencefrom <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Jebuſalem, Euphoniae gratiâ, that it might have a fair ſound and good pronunication.</hi> For there is mention of Jeruſalem, Judg. 1.8. yea before that, Joſh. 10.3. long before David expelled the Jebuſites: and in the dayes of Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, it was called <hi>Salem:</hi> for Melchizedech was <hi>King of Salem,</hi> Hebr. 7.1. Now that the Jebuſites inhabited Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem before the time of Melchizedech, or that he ſhould be King of the Jebuſites inhabiting that place, or that he ſhould expell the Jebuſites there commorant before him, or how they repoſſeſſed it till Davids time, or indeed that the name was given as S. Hierom opineth, are matters onely of conjecture, as not being backt with proofs ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if we be led with reaſon, as I ſaid before, What ſhould be the end of theſe Saints aſcending to heaven? Chriſt had no need of bodily ſervice; and we may not think that they were to bear witneſſe in heaven of Chriſts reſurrection: for the triumphant Saints need no ſuch proof, or witneſſes; their beatificall viſion and fruition exempteth them from doubting. The living had more need to know by theſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the reſurrection of Chriſt: but by them the living knew nothing at all, ſo farre as can be proved; if this going into the holy citie be to be interpreted of the ſupernall Jeruſalem. But that the words are to be expounded of Jeruſalem below, the paſſage immediately following demonſtrateth; <hi>They went into the holy citie, and appeared unto many.</hi> Certainly, if they had gone into heaven, they muſt have appeared unto <hi>all</hi> there: for as
<note n="d" place="margin">Coelum est ſingulis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>No corner of heaven is hid from any;</hi> ſo there all things preſent are ſeen face to face; their matutine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge infinitely ſurpaſſeth our veſpertine; all and every one ſee all and every one preſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet even from theſe very words, <hi>They appeared unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Maldonat gathereth, that they did not appeare common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or indifferently, or generally to all: from whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, <hi>If they aroſe to die again, they would have appeared not to many, as the Evangeliſt ſaid they did; but vulgò omnibus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly to all.</hi> I anſwer; They appeared to all; <hi>viz.</hi> All that met them, ſaw them, and ſaw them as <hi>men,</hi> and as <hi>other men;</hi> but not as <hi>newly raiſed men;</hi> for ſo onely they appeared to <hi>Many;</hi> as Chriſt himſelf did appeare <hi>Teſtibus praeordinatis à

               <p>To evince this diſtinction, let it be conſidered, whether every one who ſaw Lazarus after his reſurrection, ſaw him as a raiſed man, or as an ordinary man. But if Lazarus might appeare commonly to all men, and yet appeare unto <hi>Many</hi> onely, as a man raiſed lately from the dead; theſe Saints alſo might be ſeen, and were ſeen of all that paſſed by and looked on them <hi>(apparuerunt vulgò omnibus, they appeared ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to all;)</hi> and yet they might be ſeen not by all, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare to <hi>Many,</hi> as perſons raiſed of purpoſe for holy ends. And this opinion I hold to be more probable then that of Franciſcus Lucas Brugenſis on the place, That onely unto ſome the raiſed did <hi>aliquando apparere, aliquando diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, ſicut Jeſus, Sometime appeare to ſome, and ſometimes vaniſh, as our Saviour did.</hi> I anſwer, he had ſaid ſomewhat, if the reſurrection had been of the ſame nature with Jeſus his reſurrection. And as I diſlike him not, if by <hi>diſparere</hi> he meaneth that they did not alwayes converſe with the ſame men, but changed company: ſo if by it he underſtandeth a ſudden vaniſhing from the ſight of men, and implyeth that the <hi>Many</hi> raiſed had a power to be viſible and inviſible at their pleaſure; till he bring proof to evince it, he ſhall give me leave to parallell it to the fiction of Gyges and his ring: whoſe broad beazil, or inſealing part, if he turned to the palm of his hand, he was forthwith inviſible, yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaw all things; but if he turned it to the back ſide of his hand, he was as conſpicuous as an other man. So Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero in the third book of his offices, out of Plato.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſame Maldonat preſſeth us ſore with an other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: <hi>What ſhould they do here, living again in mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who had a taſte of Gods glory? ſurely they had been in worſe condition, then if they never had been raiſed out of the boſome of Abraham, where they were quiet, to come to a turbulent life again.</hi> Becauſe this Maldonat is an importunate ſnarler at our religion, I give him this bone to gnaw upon: and for my firſt anſwer, I will call to minde the prodigious Legend, which divers eminent men of their own ſide have record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one Chriſtina, called by them, by way of eminency,
<note n="e" place="margin">Mirabilis.</note> 
                  <hi>Wonderfull.</hi> To omit what Surius and others relate, I will ſpeak in the words of Dionyſius the Carthuſian:
<note n="f" place="margin">Cùm defuncta eſſet in pueritia, — ducta erat in paradiſum, ad Thronum Majeſtatis Divina: — Domino congraiulante, ineffabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter gaviſa eſt: Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itque Dominus, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; hac chariſſima fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtina died young, — and was carried into paradiſe to the throne of the Divine majeſty: — and ſhe was ineffably glad, God congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with her. And the Lord ſaid, Truly this is my deereſt daughter.</hi> And then he telleth, That God gave her choice, either to ſtay with him, or to return unto her bodie, and by penitentiall works to ſatisfie for all the ſouls in purgatorie, and to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6913:198"/>thoſe who lived, and to return to God,
<note n="b" place="margin">Cum meritorum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmentis.</note> 
                  <hi>with increaſe of her merits.</hi> She anſwered the Lord preſently, that for that cauſe ſhe would return to her bodie: And ſo ſhe did: and becauſe ſinnefull men by their ſtench did too much afflict her, (O tender-noſed virgin!) ſhe did flie, (or the Papiſts did lie) and ſit on the top-boughes of trees, pinacles, or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets; (ſince noiſome ſmells aſcend, it had been her farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe, to have crept into ſome dennes, and caverns of the earth, or vaults and tombes, as he ſaid ſhe did ſometimes) and when her neighbours, or kindred thought her mad, and kept her from meat, ſhe prayed once to God, and milk came out of her breaſts, (was not ſhe an intemerate rare virgin!) and ſo ſhe refreſhed herſelf. This, and a great deal more hath that Carthuſian, (holy and learned above many of their ſide) <hi>de quatuor noviſsimis part.</hi> 3. <hi>Artic.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Let cenſorious and maledicent Maldonat ponder theſe things well; and it will ſtop his mouth for ever from bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the belief of us, whom they ſtyle Hugonets, Calviniſts, Hereticks; though none of us think, or ſay otherwiſe, then the good Pacianus did of old, in his firſt epiſtle to Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, CHRISTIAN <hi>is my name, and</hi> CATHOLICK <hi>is my ſurname.</hi> The Turks indeed have ſome ſtrange figments of this nature: but though the Mahumetan prieſts have deviſed and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many ſuperſtitious miracles concerning their great Sainteſſe Nafiſſa, as is confeſſed by Joannes Leo in his African hiſtorie, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. yet the Papiſts have ſurmounted both this and other their impoſtures, with this their mirabilarie Chriſtina.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning theſe <hi>Many</hi> raiſed, I anſwer unto Maldonat, They continued not long in this life, but (as I gueſſe) ſhortly after Chriſts aſcenſion, laid their bodies down to ſleep again in the earth. Thirdly, what thinks Maldonat of Lazarus? Was not his ſoul in Abrahams boſome (as well as the other poore Lazarus his ſoul) who was ſo tenderly beloved of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles? and yet he lived long after: and whatſoever can be objected againſt theſe Saints, holds ſtronger againſt Lazarus. Fourthly, I denie that they by their return into the fleſh, were in worſe condition. Lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus on Acts 9.41. ſaith,
<note n="c" place="margin">Non affert moleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ut Deo vocanti mortuus obtemperet reviviſcendo.</note> 
                  <hi>It is no trouble to a man, if being dead he obey Gods call, and live again.</hi> And Salmeron ſaith, No reaſon, but holy men at Gods command may put on and put off their own bodies as well, and as contentedly, as the Angels do their aſſumed bodies: which I do the rather beleeve, becauſe I do ſay with Toſtatus, on the 2. King. 4. Quaeſt. 56, <hi>Though it cannot be certainly proved, yet it is probable, That none of thoſe that ever were raiſed, did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh everlaſtingly, nor that any reprobate had the favour of an extraordinary reſurrection: for a ſeparated ſoul that hath
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6913:198"/>been partaker of theſe unſpeakable joyes, will eſteem worſe then dung, or ſalt that hath loſt its ſavour, all the pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of this life; though their ſeverall excellencies were diſtilled into one quinteſſence of perfection.</hi> So that, as Lorinus ſaith well in the place above cited, <hi>Whoſoever hath once eſcaped the perill of damnation, he ſhall not come into the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt objection that I have met withall is this, That to die the ſecond time is no favour, but a puniſhment; and a puniſhment iterated. I anſwer, If a righteous man ſhould die thrice, or oftner; death is no puniſhment unto him; yea to paſſe ſeven times through hell, to come once and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly to heaven, a deſpairing ſoul would hold to be a cheap bleſſedneſſe. Secondly, Suarez himſelf ſaith, <hi>It is no puniſhment to die the ſecond time, no more then it was to Moſes, to die twice; as ſaith Auguſtine, de Mirabilib. Scripturae</hi> 3.10. <hi>though others diſſent from Auguſtine.</hi> Nay (ſaith Suarez) <hi>To lay down their bodies the ſecond time, is more acceptable and pleaſing to God.</hi> To this doth Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr agree in 1. King. 4.22. <hi>If by mans hurt, or loſſe, God be glorified; it is no injurie to man.</hi> But in truth it is no hurt, or loſſe to man: for, ſaith Barradius, <hi>Perchance, without any pains they might redeliver their carcaſes to the earth:</hi> And if the pains be any; <hi>the pains both of the latter and former death, may be ſo tempered and diminiſhed, that they both ſhall not exceed the pains of one death,</hi> ſaith Peter Martyr, <hi>ibid.</hi> Which learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Peter Martyr out of S. Auguſtine <hi>de Mirabilib. Scripturae</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> hath an excellent obſervation or two. Firſt, That to every man is ſetled and appointed a prefixed time of death. Secondly, That before the laſt prefixed time ſome do die, that they that raiſe them up to life may be more famous, and God more glorified. And this is proved by the very phraſe which Chriſt uſed concerning Lazarus, John 11.4. <hi>This ſickneſſe is not unto death:</hi> Yet did he die; and beſides the time intercedent between his death and his buriall, he was foure dayes buried. But his ſickneſſe was not
<note n="d" place="margin">Ad mortem plenam, in qua Lazarus mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</note> 
                  <hi>to an intire death, in which eſtate he ſhould remain.</hi> Neither is that ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called death,
<note n="e" place="margin">Quando praeoccupat ultimum terminum.</note> 
                  <hi>when it is abortive, and cometh before its time.</hi> So, Luke 8.52. <hi>She is not dead, but ſleepeth;</hi> and yet verſe 55. <hi>her ſpirit came again:</hi> Therefore it was gone, and ſhe was dead. So that we may ſhut up this point with this percloſe, and with a diſtinction out of Peter Martyr, from S. Auguſtine; Death is ſo termed, either <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; compleatly,</hi> or <hi>incompleatly.</hi> If you take death <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>compleatly,</hi> for that ſeparation of the ſoul, which cannot admit an other conjunction or union with the bodie till the generall reſurrection: then no man ever died but once, or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6913:199"/>was come <hi>ad plenam mortem,</hi> to that prefixed period and laſt houre of life; but their former death was onely <hi>improper, preparatorie,</hi> and <hi>abortive.</hi> Now if you take death <hi>improperly</hi> and <hi>incompleatly,</hi> for any manner of true ſeparation, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the commoneſt acception; a man may die twice, and divers have died twice; yea, all they that ever were raiſed in the Old and New Teſtament (except our Saviour onely, who cooperated to his own reſurrection) all they, and every of them, died the ſecond time.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In Matthew Paris, on the eleventh yeare of Henry the third, <hi>anno Chriſti</hi> 1228. in his greater hiſtorie printed at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:6913:200"/>London, pag. 470. it is ſaid, That an Arch-biſhop of Armenia came into England in pilgrimage; was entertained at S. Albans Abby: Being there asked touching that Joſeph, of whom there was a common ſpeech, that he was preſent when Chriſt ſuffered, and ſpake with him, and that he yet liveth as a firm proof of the Chriſtian faith; the Arch-biſhop an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he knew Joſeph well; and the Antiochian (who was the interpreter to the Arch-biſhop) told the whole ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thus to Henry Spigurnel his acquaintance, and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots ſervant, That before the Arch-biſhop came out of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, Joſeph uſed to be at his table; that at the Paſsion when Chriſt was haled from before Pilate to the croſſe, the ſaid Joſeph (then called <hi>Cartaphilus)</hi> being uſher of the Court, did moſt ſcornfully punch Chriſt on the back, as he went out of the doore; and mocking ſaid, <hi>Go faſter Jeſus: Go, Why ſtayeſt thou?</hi> But Chriſt looking back with a ſtern eye and countenance on him, ſaid, <hi>I go indeed, but thou ſhalt expect,</hi> or <hi>ſtay till I come:</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Sonne of Man goeth indeed, as it is written of him; and muſt be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and die, and ſhall live again: but thou ſhalt abide, and not die, till my ſecond coming.</p>
               <p>It is further added, that this Cartaphilus was, at the time of Chriſts death, about thirty yeares old; and ſo often as he cometh to one hundred yeares, he is taken with a ſeeming incurable diſeaſe, and is as it were in an ecſtaſie: then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better, <hi>redit redivivus, returneth young, lively and luſty,</hi> to the ſtate of thirty yeares. After Chriſts death he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized by Ananias (who baptized S. Paul) and was called <hi>Joſeph:</hi> he is reputed to be a man of a moſt auſtere and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent life, humble, and patient; and liveth in both the Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaes, among Clergy men. Thus farre Matthew Paris; who was a Monk of Saint Albans, at that time. And in the like words the ſtorie is reported by Thomas of Rudbourn, a Monk of Wincheſter, in his Chronicle, which is a manuſcript; as the great ſearcher of antiquities M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Selden, my very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friend, aſſured me.</p>
               <p>If this Joſeph <hi>redit redivivus,</hi> he hath not died twice one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but very often.</p>
               <p>I have recounted theſe narrations for their pleaſant vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties; perhaps (I may ſay) rarities: But as S. Auguſtine brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the former ſtorie, and the beleevers of it, ſaying,

                  <hi>The great preſumption of theſe opinioniſts makes me much marvell:</hi> So I will not be afraid to tax the latter of impoſture: both becauſe of the varietie of Names, by which he is called, as you may finde in the learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Seldens illuſtrations on Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyolbion, pag. 15. where he alſo citeth the incredible fable of Ruan, which is couſin-german to the relation of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6913:200"/>Cartaphilus; and becauſe the Armenians, as well as the Romans, have their holy frauds: as was ſeen by our men, laught at by the Turks, and beleeved by the ſilly Laicks of Armenia, whileſt their Prieſts would ſtrive to fetch falſe fire from Chriſts ſepulchre on Eaſter even. See M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sands in his third book, pag. 173.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if this ſtorie of the Armenian could be an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth; the Greek Church would ere this have produced him, to juſtifie the practiſe and opinions of the Eaſtern Church againſt the Weſtern, wherein they diſſented: But no ſuch thing was ever attempted: And therefore let this be caſt into the number of fables.</p>

That he was judged in the particular judgement of ſouls, cannot be; ſince himſelf is there the Judge. So ſhall he alſo be judge in the generall judgement.</p>
               <p>But let us return to the univerſalls. Matth. 26.33. <hi>Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended:</hi> yet was he a man: and if the words there be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Chriſts Diſciples or Apoſtles; yet Peter accounts himſelf none of that all; and exempts himſelf from the number of them that would be ſcandalized. 1. Corinth. 15.27. <hi>He hath put all things under his feet: But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted which did put all things under him.</hi> Heb. 11.13. <hi>Theſe All died in faith:</hi> Yet Aquinas truely there excepteth Enoch.</p>
               <p>Aquinas, <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>lib.

Why then, by the eſpeciall grace of the ſame God, may not ſome be freed from the ſtroke of death?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Salmeron tuggeth it out hard by the teeth, to uphold
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6913:204"/>that none ſhall be acquitted from death; but, without exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, all muſt die. Hearken to his reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Si Chriſto &amp; matri Chriſti mors non peper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, cui parcet?</note> 
                  <hi>If death ſpared not Chriſt and his Mother, whom will death ſpare?</hi> I anſwer, Death ſpareth none; ſo that no one can ſay, I will not die. Death ſpareth none: but he that hath the power of death, may ſpare whom he pleaſeth. Fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have no mercie: yet the three children were preſerved in the fire, and S. Peter walked upon the ſea. The rivers have divided themſelves; yea, the Red ſea gathered it ſelf toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was as a wall on the right hand and on the left, in the paſſage of the children of Iſrael toward Canaan. God, above the pitch of humane reaſon, may free whom he will from death; and ſhut up the mouth of the grave, that it ſhall not ſwallow ſome, as he did the mouthes of the lions, when he ſaved Daniel.</p>
               <p>Again ſaith Salmeron,
<note n="o" place="margin">Qui cum Chriſto mortui non ſunt, non reſurgent, nec erunt membra ejus.</note> 
                  <hi>Who die not with Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>as well as Chriſt, ſhall not ariſe, nor be members of his bodie.</hi> All the Jeſuits in the earth cannot demonſtrate that propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they uſe S. Auguſtines reaſon,
<note n="p" place="margin">Reſurrectio eſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lummodo mortuorum: At omnes reſurgent: Ergòomnes morientur.</note> 
                  <hi>Onely the dead ſhall ariſe: But all ſhall ariſe: Therefore all ſhall die:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with S. Auguſtine, and many more (what is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at large in the third part)
<note n="q" place="margin">Immutatio erit vice reſurrectionis.</note> 
                  <hi>Change ſhall be a kinde of reſurrection:</hi> and in the propoſition, <hi>The dead</hi> are not taken ſtrictly; but largely, for any ſuch as have changed their firſt life. But take we <hi>the dead</hi> properly and natively, for ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as indeed have died; the propoſition is falſe, and muſt be denied; ſince we ſhall not all die, but ſome ſhall be changed; and yet both the one and the other ſort ſhall be raiſed.</p>
               <p>Salmeron again, on 1. Cor. 15. thus objecteth;
<note n="r" place="margin">Tardante Sponſo, dormitaverunt omnes, &amp; dormierunt.</note> 
                  <hi>While the bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbred and ſlept,</hi> Matth. 25.5. Did not Salmeron ſleep, ſlumber, and dream, when he produceth theſe words to prove that all ſhall die? when the words have apparent reference to the ſupine ſecuritie of their mindes; and perhaps, if you will, to their bodily ſluggiſhneſſe, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and ſleep, if there were any realitie in the parable. Death was never meant in theſe words: for Chriſt doth not <hi>there,</hi> that is, <hi>at the reſurrection,</hi> tarrie; but <hi>he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarrie,</hi> Heb. 10.37. He continueth objecting thus;

Secondly, even they themſelves who ſay <hi>All muſt die,</hi> cannot take the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as they ſound. For then as the ſeed hath time to rot, and rotteth ere it quicken: ſo the bodies of men ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6913:204"/>corruption and putrifaction, as the ſeeds do; which they dare not ſay.

               </p>
               <p>An other objection is, Geneſ. 3.19. <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return.</hi> Peter Martyr anſwereth,

The ſame Arias interprets <hi>The ſmiting of the earth with a curſe</hi> (Mal. 4.6.) by laying it waſte and deſolate, as Judea hath been from the time of Titus.</p>
               <p>The reverend Biſhop thus recollecteth: Elias was to be ſent before the coming of Chriſt, Malachi 4.5: Before the firſt coming none was ſent in the ſpirit of Elias, but John: The firſt coming is to be underſtood, and not the ſecond, by the confeſſion of our learned adverſaries. Elias was called <hi>the meſſenger</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> Malac. 3.1. ſo is John called, Matth. 11.10, Mark 1.2, Luke 7.27. <hi>Elias was to come,</hi> Matth. 17.11; but, <hi>This is Elias which was for to come,</hi> Matth. 11.14; and, <hi>Elias is now come,</hi> Matth. 17.12. <hi>Elias ſhall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> Mal. 4.6. <hi>John the Baptiſt ſhall go before him, in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> Luk. 1.17. Let me adde theſe things, That Elias is called <hi>the Prophet,</hi> Mal. 4.5. and, <hi>He ſhall prepare the way before the Lord,</hi> Mal. 3.1. So John the Baptiſt, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell-wiſe, Luk. 1.76. is called <hi>the Prophet—which ſhall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of the Lord, to prepare his wayes:</hi> Yea, <hi>More then a Prophet,</hi> Matth. 11.9. S. Hierom, on Matth. 11. draweth out the parallels to more length: <hi>John came in the vertue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Elias;

               <p>Again, the firſt coming of Chriſt is neceſſarily to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Malachi. For <hi>the meſſenger,</hi> and <hi>the covenant whom ye delight in,</hi> are coupled together, Mal. 3.1. but no covenant, that we delight in, cometh at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, but did come at the firſt approach of the Meſſias, even the covenant of peace. Moreover, what <hi>offerings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Jeruſalem ſhall be pleaſant to the Lord, as in the dayes of old, and as in former yeares,</hi> Malach. 3.4? ſhall ſuch offerings be after Chriſts ſecond coming? And, if ſuch were; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, he ſaith, Mal. 3.5. <hi>Chriſt will come neare to you to judgement;</hi> Shall we have an other judgement after the ſecond, which the Spirit of God calleth the <hi>Eternall judgement,</hi> Heb. 6.2. and is the laſt judgement, by an univerſall agreement? Beſides, as the laſt day may be called, and truely is, <hi>a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day;</hi> yet the righteous are then to <hi>hold up their heads,</hi> Luk. 21.28. and it ſhall be a day of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> to them; though it be <hi>diſmall</hi> to the wicked: So the day of Chriſts firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, though it was accompanied with <hi>good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people,</hi> Luke 2.10. yet was it alſo a <hi>dreadfull day</hi> to the wicked and diſobedient men; worſe, then if he had never come: and it was dolefull alſo to the evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whom he then vanquiſhed, caſt out, and <hi>tormented before their time,</hi> Matth. 8.29. triumphing over them in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and trampling them down, and breaking them in pieces with his rod of iron, in their own kingdome: and therefore may juſtly be called, in reſpect of them, <hi>a terrible day.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets teſtimonie reacheth home, for confirmation hereof, Iſa. 61.2. <hi>He hath ſent me to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn.</hi> Which Propheſie Chriſt himſelf (Luke 4.18, &amp;c.) appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his firſt coming, and addeth remarkably (verſ. 21) <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares.</hi> The day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (you ſee) is threatned in Chriſts firſt coming: And is not the day of vengeance unto ſuch, to whom vengeance paſſively belongeth, a <hi>terrible day?</hi> Which truth is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that admirable ſimilitude fore-propheſied in the law of Moſes, and applied to Chriſt in the law of Grace; concerning Chriſts being, not onely a <hi>chief corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.6. and <hi>the head of the corner,</hi> Pſal. 118.22. <hi>Elect and precious,</hi> ſaith S.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6913:207"/>many ſhall ſtumble, and fall, and be broken, and ſnared, and taken,</hi> Iſa. 8.14. &amp;c. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall fall on this ſtone, ſhall be broken: but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it ſhall grinde him to powder,</hi> Matth. 21.44.

               <p>Laſtly, it is inſinuated, that Chriſt, when he cometh, may <hi>ſmite the earth with a curſe:</hi> which muſt be underſtood of his firſt coming: for after his ſecond coming, after the day of judgement, the earth is not to be curſed, but rather bleſſed: For there ſhall be <hi>a new heaven, and a new earth; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>To this day many think and beleeve that this propheſie of Malachi was onely by the Baptiſt in part fulfilled: and they hold that Eliah ſhall perſonally and bodily appeare, toward the ſecond coming of our Lord, before the laſt judgement. Whether theſe things be true or falſe, I determine not: This onely I will ſay, The Jews do as yet, and to this houre look for Eliah to come with their Meſsiah: and of him they have this ſaying, WHEN ELIAH COMETH, HE SHALL TEACH <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ALL THINGS.</hi> I reply; What part, what ſyllable in Malachi concerning Elias, was not fulfilled by John the Baptiſt? If many do now beleeve otherwiſe, they are ſuch as are Jews, who neither beleeve the words of our Saviour, who ſaid Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as was come; and therefore think Elias ſhall come, becauſe they think their Meſſias is not come at all: or at leaſt they do Judäize in this point, whoſoever they be that expect the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall coming of the Tiſhbite.</p>
               <p>Chriſtopher Caſtrus the Jeſuit, on Malach. 4.8. concludeth, That the true Elias ſhall yet come, becauſe it was the voice of the Jews, and the expectation of the Scribes and Phariſees; who ſaid in the ſame places, that Elias ſhould come

                  <hi>before Chriſts glorious appearing, as S. Hierom writeth on Matthew.</hi> Firſt, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Jews did expect the coming of their Meſſias, to be glorious in all worldly pomp. Secondly, I call not now to minde, that the Scribes, Phariſees, or Jews, ever expected a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of their Meſſias. Thirdly, whereas our Saviour ſaith, Matth. 17.11. <hi>Elias truely ſhall firſt come, and reſtore all things:</hi> though theſe words were ſpoken after John the Baptiſt was beheaded, yet Chriſt meaneth not, that Elias ſhall come corporally; but in anſwering his diſciples, he propoundeth the objection of the Jews, which they before alledged more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſpeaketh according to their opinion: <hi>Elias indeed ſhall come;</hi> and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the verſe following, Chriſt ſaith unto his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6913:208"/>diſciples thus in effect, by way of correction, <hi>Whatſoever the Scribes ſay or affirm concerning Elias his bodily coming, is not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be underſtood; B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T I SAY <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTO YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, THAT ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AS IS COME ALREADY.</hi> And what he ſaith to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here, he ſaith to the people, Matth. 11.14. <hi>If ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, This is Elias which was for to come.</hi> He fore-knew that ſome would not beleeve him; and therefore he ſaid, <hi>If ye will receive it, This is Elias;</hi> This John, who then did live, this John <hi>is Elias;</hi> not which ſhall come (this is the expoſition of the Jews:) but this John is that Elias which <hi>was to come,</hi> and now is come, and the propheſie fulfilled. <hi>He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt words (as Hierom well obſerveth) do evince, that the former, to wit, <hi>If ye will receive it, This is Elias,</hi> are myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and hard to be underſtood; no plain ſenſe, or manifeſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Whence I inferre, that plain and eaſie it would have been to the Jews, if he would have ſaid, as they did think, That Elias ſhould come bodily; although the Baptiſt did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in vertue and power, and was equall unto him. But here is the myſterie, That Malachi never intended, that Elias ſhould live on earth corporally, againſt Chriſts ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: but that the Baptiſt was prefigured in Elias; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was propheſied by Malachi of Elias, was accompliſhed by the Baptiſt: and no other Elias to come, but the Baptiſt in vertue and power of Elias, and not according to the outward letter. Here is a myſterie, here is depth, which the
<note n="c" place="margin">Judaei, &amp; Judaizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haeretici.</note> 
                  <hi>Jews and Jewiſhly addicted hereticks</hi> (as Hierom ſtyleth them) will hardly beleeve.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bellarmine, <hi>de Rom. Pontif.</hi> 3.6. draweth the ſecond and third part of his third demonſtration from two places of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus: The firſt is, Chap. 48. verſ. 10. <hi>Who waſt ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacifie the wrath of the Lords judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before it brake forth into furie, and to turn the heart of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto the ſonne, and to reſtore</hi> (or <hi>eſtabliſh) the tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Firſt, I may anſwer, Eccleſiaſticus is not held Canonicall, but Apocryphall; even by ſuch as, for the many divine and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in that book, could wiſh (if it were no ſinne to wiſh) that it were truely Canonicall: And Apocryphals are not held ſufficient to ſettle a point of controverſie. Secondly, it may be alſo ſaid, that Janſenius maintaineth, this place evinceth not that Elias ſhall come perſonally; becauſe Eccleſiaſticus wrote according to the received opinion of thoſe times, which, from the words of Malachi, beleeved that Elias was to come in his own proper perſon. Bellarmines reply upon Janſenius, is ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in this point, ſaying,
<note n="d" place="margin">Si it à eſt, ut Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius dicit, ſequitur Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticum errâſſe, &amp; falſa ſcripſiſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>If Janſenius ſaith truth, it followeth that Eccleſiaſticus hath erred, and writ ſome falſe things:</hi> as if he, who writeth the opinion of others, may not relate an errour,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6913:208"/>and write falſe things; though he erre not himſelf, nor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the falſe things. S. Matthew, chap. 2.6. wrote what the Jews ſaid concerning the place of Chriſts birth; the things were miſcited, and yet no errour or fault in S. Matthew. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth hath written, that <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God.</hi> Becauſe the fool thought fooliſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly, God forbid that we ſhould turn fools alſo, and think that the holy Ghoſt did erre, becauſe he truely recordeth an untrue opinion, or an untrue thing, true onely in the relation. This have I ſaid, to defend both Janſenius and Eccleſiaſticus, againſt Bellarmine. Thirdly, I might anſwer, Onely theſe laſt words have the ſhadow of an argument, <hi>To reſtore,</hi> or <hi>to eſtabliſh the tribes of Iſrael:</hi> which becauſe John did not do, Elias muſt do hereafter. For indeed it is but a ſhadow; ſince as John the Baptiſt did <hi>turn the heart of the father unto the ſonne,</hi> (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved) ſo he may be alſo ſaid, <hi>to eſtabliſh,</hi> or <hi>reſtore the tribes of Iſrael;</hi> not to any temporall kingdome, which cannot be proved to be intended by Eccleſiaſticus, (for in Malachi there is <hi>altum ſilentium, not a word ſpoken</hi> concerning this point:) but to the true ſervice of God, from which they were fallen: for he preached unto ſome of all ſorts; of the two tribes, of the ten tribes, yea of the Gentiles. <hi>There went out unto John, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan,</hi> Mat. 3.5. and Jordan divided Galilee from Judea: yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came from Galilee to John to be baptized, Matth. 3.13. And he taught both Publicans and Souldiers, and Herod, and ſome of all ſorts thereabouts, Luk. 3.13, 14. &amp;c. and thus did he <hi>reſtore,</hi> or <hi>eſtabliſh the tribes of Iſrael.</hi> The Biſhops Bible hath the controverted words thus; <hi>To ſet up the tribes of Iſrael.</hi> So Coverdale. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t conſtitueres tribus Jacob,</hi> ſaith Tremellius; according to the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but no where doth it ſignifie, to reſtore unto a diſperſed people their loſt kingdome; which is the hope of the Jews, or the expoſition of the Jewiſhly affected: nor is the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But mine own opinion is, that Eccleſiaſticus propheſieth not, what ſhould be thereafter, <hi>viz.</hi> after the day of his writing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning John, or Elias; but onely relateth what was paſt: and it is an Eulogie, and laudatorie of Elias his worth; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the antecedent, and conſequent narratives; where all runnes in terms deſigning out times paſſed and gone, none touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the preſent tenſe or time, much leſſe at the future: and ſo it can be no propheſie concerning Elias perſonally to come
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6913:209"/>hereafter; eſpecially ſince there is never a paſſage in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus concerning Elias, which Elias did not accompliſh before his aſſumption: and more particularly, he reconciled God to his children the Iſraelites, and turned their hearts to him. Thus did he <hi>reſtore,</hi> or <hi>eſtabliſh the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> in his time: for, 1. King. 18.21. <hi>Elias ſaid unto all the people</hi> (that were gathered out of Iſrael) <hi>How long will ye halt between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him:</hi> And then by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle under God, he eſtabliſhed them, or reſtored the tribes to the right religion, from which they were fallen by idolatrie, the fall of all falls fowleſt. Even Bellarmine himſelf expounds <hi>Reſtituerunt, they reſtored,</hi> by <hi>Converterunt, they converted,</hi> in this very chapter: thus farre truely proving, that Zuinglius and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not the Enoch and Elias propheſied of; becauſe Elias was to convert the Jews, and indeed converted many, (as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before) which neither Luther nor Zuinglius did, for ought that I have read.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſecond place inſiſted upon by Bellarmine, is Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus 44.16. <hi>Enoch was tranſlated, being an example of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all generations.</hi> The Septuagint have it thus, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Laſtly, it is not ſo much as intended by any word of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus, that Enoch ſhall hereafter appeare in the fleſh perſonally, and then die; and be an example of repentance to the Nations: for after he had ſo long pleaſed God and walked with God in this world, and after he was taken by God from amongſt men (and no doubt, much more, then pleaſed God, and walked with God) if he ſhould come again into this world, here to live; ſhould he ſinne again, that he might be an example of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? The conceit is vaſt, harſh, and improbable, if the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall ſhould have a certain accompliſhment: but that this, and all other controverted points of moment, concerning Enoch, or Elias, may be the better cleared, let us examine theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:6913:209"/>
               <p n="1">1. Whether Enoch in his life-time, was ever any great ſinner?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether Enoch did ever die?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether Enoch and Elias now live in and with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in Paradiſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether ever they ſhall die; or do live with glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the higheſt heavens?</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, <hi>Whether Enoch in his life-time was ever any grievous ſinner?</hi> Firſt, I anſwer and ſay, I ſpeak not of the firſt Enoch, the ſonne of Cain, the grand-childe of Adam and Eve, in honour and memoriall of whom, <hi>Cain built a citie, and called the name of the citie after the name of his ſonne, Enoch,</hi> Geneſ. 4.17. but of the ſecond and younger Enoch, the ſonne of Jared, Geneſ. 5.18. of the poſteritie of Seth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I queſtion not, but that this latter, beſt Enoch, was a ſinner; and in his own eſtimate, a great ſinner: and he might have ſaid, and doubtleſſe did ſay in effect, as David did, and as Adam, and all his of-ſpring (except Chriſt) <hi>Have mercie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, O God,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. and, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. <hi>O Lord pardon mine iniquitie, for it is great,</hi> Pſal. 25.11. And in the ballance of God (ſetting aſide mercie) he might have been weighed, found light, and accounted for a main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. But this is the <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether comparatively, and in reſpect of other men, even of ſuch whoſe lives ends alſo pleaſed God, he was ſo notorious a ſinner, that he alone was the fitteſt example of repentance to ſucceeding generations? My anſwer is negatively: for I am ſure, Adam, and, as I think, Noah, and Lot, and divers other holy Patriarchs, might as well, yea rather, be an example of repentance to future times, then Enoch; eſpecially, if we meaſure ſinnes by the records of Scripture: for the holy Writ hath more amply inſiſted upon their ſinnes, then upon Enochs; and no part of the Canonicall Scripture toucheth at any thing that was extraordinarily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in Enoch; but magnifieth his goodneſſe, Gen. 5.22. and his faith, Heb. 11.5. Yet, becauſe the divine Writ might omit the offences of Enoch; and becauſe I cannot think that Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus wrote without ſome ground; let us ſearch what other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours have conceited, or written, for, or againſt Enoch.</p>
               <p>Some think that Enoch, all the courſe of his converſation amongſt men in this world, lived unblameably, and walked with God. Some Jews held, that Enoch was an incarnate Angel;

                  <hi>Whileſt he lived, he lived worthy of praiſe,</hi> ſaith Druſius. Others write, that in his youth he was very wicked; but after repented, and turned heartily to God, redeeming the time. Druſius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that Enoch was a good man ſtill, by theſe arguments. Joſephus, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 1.5. at the end ſaith, <hi>Seth was a vertuous man, and left

               <p>On the other ſide,
<note n="i" place="margin">Sunt qui inſimulan; eum levitatis &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiae: nam aiunt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò juſtum, modò impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum fuiſſe. Id relatum in Geneſi magno.</note> 
                  <hi>Some ſay he was light and inconſtant: ſometimes juſt, ſometimes wicked; as is recorded in the great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> (a book called in Hebrew, <hi>BERESITH RABBA) made by one Ibbo:</hi> ſo relateth Druſius in his book called Henoch, chap. 5. If Ibbo had ſaid, <hi>Henochum fuiſſe modò improbum, modò ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum, That Enoch was now and then wicked, now and then juſt;</hi> I ſhould farre rather have conſented: for every juſt man, except Chriſt, was ſometime wicked. But that Enoch, after he was once juſt, turned to be extraordinarily wicked, I can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. For the Spirit would never have given him this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that he pleaſed God, and walked with him; if he had after returned as the dog to his vomit, or as the ſow to her wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire. Rabbi Levi the ſonne of Gerſom thus,
<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Enoch ambulavit in viis Domini, poſtquam genuit Methuſalem, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> 300.</note> 
                  <hi>Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuſalem,</hi> 300 <hi>yeares:</hi> whereby he intimateth that he walked,
<note n="l" place="margin">Non in viis domini, ſed in viis ſeculi ſui.</note> 
                  <hi>Not in the narrow paths of the Lord, but in the high wayes of the world:</hi> and by that account he might be wicked ſixtie fiye yeares of his age, or thereabouts. The arguments of either ſide are but weak, and may be eaſily anſwered. Seths poſteritie might do ſome notable wicked acts; and moſt heartily repent, and be both holy, and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſonnes of God. The phraſe uſed concerning his being taken out of this world, evinceth not, that all the former paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life were juſt. Thirdly, he might live in Adams time, yet not neare him: and he might live with him, and yet not miniſter unto him: and he might miniſter unto him, and yet be wicked before he miniſtred; yea, even for a time whileſt he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto Adam. Many godly parents have lived to ſee wicked ones of their of-ſpring: and it may be that Adam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him not, till after ſome time that he miniſtred unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and had ſeen evident ſignes of Adams own great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, Ibbo writeth like a fabler; and his words were before rejected, as improbable. Rabbi Levi, alledging no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but conjecture, wanteth weight for an argument.</p>
               <p>Now, as there is nothing certain, either <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>contra;</hi> ſo, if my opinion be asked, I ſhall manifeſt my ſelf to think, that Enoch was ſometimes a grievous ſinner; and after, a moſt contrite repentant, and a moſt holy man. My reaſon is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I aſcribe more to the books called Apocryphall, then to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6913:211"/>any humane Authour: for they alone are, and have been many hundreds of yeares, joyned with the Canonicall Scripture, and read in all Churches, except the Jewiſh, at ſet times, as well as the Canonicall; as no other writings of any other are. And if no part of them were divinely inſpired: yet were the men that wrote them, both holy and learned; and the Churches of God have dignified them above all other writings.</p>
               <p>Now, though the undoubted Canon mentioneth not any evill act or acts of Enoch (as millions of millions of matters are omitted, both in the Old and New Teſtament;) yet ſome paſſages of the Apocryphals bend me to think, that Enoch was ſometimes a great ſinner: for he was an example of repentance unto poſteritie: therefore, in likelihood, his ſinne was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie, and his repentance proportioned in a ſort unto it.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſaid, John 13.15. <hi>I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you;</hi> the precedent actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that he ſhewed great humilitie, and brotherly love, to which he exhorted them. When S. James ſaith, chap. 5.10. <hi>Take the Prophets for an example of ſuffering affliction, and of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;</hi> it may be juſtly inferred, that they ſuffered great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and were very patient. So when Eccleſiaſticus ſaith, Enoch was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which is the ſame word, that is uſed in both the former places) <hi>an example of repentance;</hi> the reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is fair; Enoch was a very great penitent; otherwiſe he was unfit to be an example unto others; ſince exemplarie men and actions have alwayes ſomewhat above ordinary in their kinde, and are ſo excellent therein, that they are ſeldome or never out-gone by any that follow them. As the picture (though <hi>taken to life,</hi> as they call it) cometh ſhort of the lively bodie; and artificials of naturals: ſo doth the <hi>exempla. tum,</hi> the <hi>duplicate,</hi> or <hi>counterpain,</hi> of the <hi>exemplar,</hi> the <hi>pattern,</hi> or <hi>originall.</hi> We attain not to that perfection which S. Paul had, though he commanded us to follow his example: nor he to the intire perfection of Chriſt, whom S. Paul ſet before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the example to imitate.</p>
               <p>Let no man nicely inſiſt, that <hi>exemplum</hi> and <hi>exemplar</hi> do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. I profeſſe, that I weigh not matters to ſcruples, or half-ſcruples; but, though I know ſome take <hi>exemplar</hi> for the man from whom the example was taken, yet I uſe the words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly: Enoch was <hi>an example of repentance;</hi> therefore he was ſometimes a great ſinner: ſince as there needeth no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance where is no ſinne; ſo he is Stoically mad, who thinketh that there needeth as great repentance for ſmall ſinnes, as for great. Degrees of ſinnes ought to have proportionable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of repentance. The ſacrifices were more chargeable for hainous crimes, then for little offences. Indeed one may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably think, that Enoch was no chief delinquent; but did (as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:6913:212"/>tender conſciences will) repent much, even for ſmaller ſinnes: and an inference may be thus made; If Enoch ſo much repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a few motes, for ſinnes not unto death; how fit is he to be an example of repentance to us, who have ſinned a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe, and have beams upon beams in our eyes, and repent a thouſand times leſſe? But I rather think, according to the uſe of the phraſe in other places, that his being an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of repentance, proveth, both <hi>primarily,</hi> that he was a chief penitent; and <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> that there was ſome proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his repentance and his ſinne. Which I rather embrace, becauſe of another place, <hi>viz.</hi> Wiſd. 4.10. <hi>He pleaſed God, and was beloved of him, ſo that living among ſinners, he was tranſlated:</hi> and verſ. 11. <hi>Yea, ſpeedily was he taken away, leaſt that wickedneſſe ſhould alter his underſtanding, or deceit beguile his ſoul:</hi> and ver. 13. <hi>He being made perfect</hi> (conſummated or ſanctified) <hi>in a ſhort time, fulfilled a long time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My firſt obſervation is this, That theſe verſes are meant of Enoch; ſince the Apoſtle ſeemeth to have alluded to the place, Heb. 11.5. which I marvell that the learned Holcot and Lyra did not ſo much as once touch at; but apply the words, with violence, to the generalitie; though the narration be in the paſſed time, not in the preſent, much leſſe in the future.</p>
               <p>With mine opinion Druſius agreeth, expounding the words of Enoch: and the margin of Vatablus, and of the old Biſhops bibles, and of Coverdales, and of our laſt Tranſlations, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and as it were with the finger point at the ſtorie of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch. The ſecond point is <hi>in confeſſo, cleare</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> That Enoch was aſſumed whileſt he was in an holy eſtate. The third, That he was ſometimes wicked; as may be intimated from theſe paſſages:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he lived among ſinners: which all men els did, as well as Enoch, unleſſe the place be meant of notorious ſinners: and though an Abraham may be in Ur; a Lot, in Sodom: yet even both of them in thoſe places contracted ſome corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They who walk in the ſunne, are ſomewhat ſunne-burnt.

               <p>Thirdly, ſaith the Text, <hi>He was ſpeedily taken away:</hi> preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as Lot was by the Angel pulled out of Sodom by the hand, Geneſ. 19.16. or Habakkuk by the hair of the head; or as the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, Act. 8.39.</p>

                  <hi>Enoch was juſt; but apt to return to wickedneſſe: therefore God haſtened to tranſlate him,</hi> ſaith Rabbi Solomo. Procopius Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaeus Sophiſta in his Commentarie on the place, thus;

                  <hi>If then at laſt Enoch pleaſed God, after he had begot Methuſalem, certainly before he begat him, as the Scripture ſaith, God did not like him, nor accept of him: Therefore it is to be aſcribed to Enochs repentance which he performed, that God made ſo much of him, and loved him.</hi> Though Salianus ſaith of this teſtimonie, that

                  <hi>his minde was againſt it:</hi> yet there is no impoſſibilitie, no nor improbabilitie in it; and howſoever it be not apodicticall, yet it is not <hi>inepta, fooliſh,</hi> as Salianus cenſureth it. He addeth, <hi>Perhaps Philo the Jew was of that opinion: for in his book de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahamo, ſpeaking of repentance, &amp;c. he bringeth Enoch in, as an example. And it ſeemeth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he followed Jeſus the ſonne of Sirach,</hi> in the words cited: <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Ecclefiaſtic. 44.16. And though he ſlubbereth over the words and matter (which are to him Canonicall) and ſaith, that <hi>The minde of the Scripture in that place is; that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch ſhall be an exemplarie penitent, not as David and Manaſſes, Peter or Mary Magdalene; but as John Baptiſt:</hi> yet, I anſwer:</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:6913:213"/>
               <p>Firſt, no Ancient ever ſaid, John Baptiſt was an example of repentance, and did repent of any enormous ſinnes; but was alwayes holy, and moſt auſtere, preventing great ſinnes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then repenting; and not ſo much bemoaning his own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as dehorting other men, and crying out againſt their iniquities, with a charge, almoſt inforcing them to repentance: whileſt himſelf ſhewed a ſigne of his being ſanctified and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, even in his mothers wombe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is as much joy over a repentant, and God is as much glorified, for point of mercie, in a Marie Magdalene, or a Peter, as in a Baptiſt, or juſt man, that needeth no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; if not more. Procopius Gazaeus, who imagined the worſt of Enochs former part of life, till he begot Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah; yet ſpeaketh very good things before, of Enoch, thus; <hi>God reſted on the ſeventh day, when he had made the world;
<note n="q" place="margin">Et nunc ille idem Deus, generatione ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptimâ, accipit (ceu ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum conſummationis ſeculi) Enochum, ut primitias rationalis creaturae, &amp;c.</note> and now the ſame God in the ſeventh generation of the world, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (as a ſigne of the ending of an age) I ſay, aſſumed Enoch as the firſt fruits of the reaſonable creature. He was out of Gods favour for a while; but when he pleaſed God, he was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily aſſumed.</hi> Thus in effect Procopius, which the Jeſuit had not much cauſe to finde fault withall. Let this ſuffice for the firſt queſtion, Whether Enoch were at any time a very wicked man?</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is, Whether Enoch did ever die?</p>
               <p>Divers Rabbins maintain that he did die: So Rabbi Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the fifth of Geneſis. Aben Ezra ſaith, <hi>His death was ſweet, and he felt no pain:</hi> which opinion, the Jeſuit Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius à Lapide aſcribeth alſo to Calvin; whether truely or falſely, I enquire not; but the matter giveth me the hint of an excurſion.</p>
               <p>Moſes ſaid from God, Geneſ. 6.3. <hi>Mans dayes ſhall be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twentie yeares;</hi> and Moſes himſelf died, when he was 120 yeares old, Deut. 34.7.

               <p>And now I return to our Enoch; whom the Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin feigneth to have been dead without any pain; againſt whom, and all other Jewiſhly-affected, I hope to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that Enoch did not die, but is now living: Heb. 11.5. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>A ſecond argument (though not ſo ſharp-pointed) is this; Of the other Patriarchs it is ſaid, <hi>They died:</hi> ſo it is recorded of Adam, <hi>Mortuus eſt,</hi> Geneſ. 5.5. of Seth, verſ. 8. of Enos, verſ. 11. of Cainan, verſ. 14. of Mehalaleel, verſ. 17. of Jared Enochs father, verſ. 20. of Methuſelah Enochs ſonne, verſ. 27. of Lamech Enochs grandchilde, verſ. 31. even of the whole holy Genealogie from Adam to Noah, of every one it is ſaid, <hi>Mortuus eſt, He dyed:</hi> except onely, when mention is made of Enoch, and then it is not ſaid, <hi>He dyed;</hi> but it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably varied thus, verſ. 24, <hi>Et non ipſe:</hi> which our later tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath, <hi>And he was not:</hi> which words, you muſt not take in too ſtrict a ſenſe: for if he had died, yet had he had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but conſiſting of ſoul and bodie, we may truly ſay, <hi>He was.</hi> How then ſhall we interpret, <hi>Et non ipſe?</hi> I named you the Rabbin, who expounds it, <hi>He died not with pain, as other men; but died ſweetly.</hi> Others thus, <hi>He was not on earth, after the ſame manner, as he was before.</hi> This is true, and well ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, Eccleſiaſticus 49.14. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon earth was no man created like Enoch; for he was taken from the earth; DE TERRA S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIS ASSVMPTVS EST, He was lifted up on high from the earth,</hi> ſaith Vatablus. This is alſo certain, that from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers expreſſions uſed concerning Enoch, and of others, in the ſame Chapter, that were not tranſlated but died, there is more ſignified of Enoch, then of others; and in that ſpeciall unuſuall phraſe ſome ſpeciall unuſuall thing is involved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Enoch; But no ſpeciall unuſall thing is ſpoken, if it be onely meant of him, as it is of others, that he died: Therefore certainly Enoch died not.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6913:215"/>I will preſent before you mine own conjecture. Firſt, I ſay that there is an <hi>hiatus</hi> in the Hebrew; and ſomewhat to be underſtood. The Spirit would leave ſome things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and put us to the ſearch. Secondly, a ſupply muſt be made one way or other, if we will fix any ſenſe on the place.

Fourthly, I ſay, the words, <hi>Et non ipſe,</hi> may commodiouſly be thus interpreted, <hi>He was not found.</hi> If any one ask, where I finde ground for this Commentarie; I anſwer, firſt, it is in the ſeventy, Geneſ. 5.24. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Non apparuit,</hi> ſaith the Interpreter, in Vatablus; or, as himſelf commenteth, <hi>Nuſquam comparuit:</hi> but it is better rendred, <hi>Non eſt inventus, He was not found.</hi> And ſo it is rendred Hebr. 11.5. where S. Paul hath taken the ſame words, letter for letter, from the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (whoſe authoritie, by themſelves conſidered, I eſteem ſomewhat above the ordinary humane) and made them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; <hi>By faith Enoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death; And was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning Enoch, theſe things I do further obſerve with ſome of the Fathers, with Aquin, and Cornelius à La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide; That he was a type of Chriſt; ſo alſo was Elias: and both their raptures, or tranſlations, were figures of Chriſts aſcenſion. Again, Hebr. 11.5. <hi>Enoch, before his tranſlation, had this teſtimonie, that he pleaſed God.</hi> He did not onely pleaſe God; but it was publiſhed, and proclaimed, and, as it were, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters teſtimoniall from heaven, or a divine certificate was made, that he pleaſed God. And therefore I hold it very probable, that as Elijahs aſſumption was known before-hand to <hi>the ſonnes of the Prophets, that were at Beth-el,</hi> 2. Kings, 2.3. and to <hi>the ſonnes of the Prophets, that were at Jericho,</hi> verſ. 5. as well as to Eliſhah himſelf; ſo was the tranſlation of Enoch alſo, known to thoſe of his time, unto whom God teſtified that Enoch pleaſed him. And it is conformable alſo to the Antitype; becauſe Chriſt before told his Diſciples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his departure, John 14.28, &amp;c. John 16.5, &amp;c. and verſ. 16, &amp;c. and more punctually, concerning his aſcenſion, John 20.17. <hi>I am not yet aſcended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</hi> Which words Chriſt ſpake, after his reſurrection from the dead, unto Mary Magdalen. Yea further, let me expatiate, in ſhewing the correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Enoch in the law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Elias in the law of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6913:216"/>
                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our all-glorious Saviour in the law of <hi>Grace.</hi> Even as Eliſhah ſaw the carrying up of Eliah 2. Kings, 2.12. yea, and fifty men of the ſonnes of the Prophets beheld the ſame, (as it is likely 2. Kings, 2.7, 15, and 16 verſes:) ſo it may very well be, that God was pleaſed to give bodily ſight, and evidence of Enoch, at his tranſlation, to thoſe unto whom he gave teſtimonie before his tranſlation, that he pleaſed God. And even this fraction the ſubſtance of our Saviours aſcenſion doth ſtrengthen and enlighten. For, <hi>He was ſeen,</hi> not onely after his reſurrection, <hi>of Cephas; then of the twelve: after that, he was ſeen of above</hi> 500 <hi>brethren at once,</hi> 1. Corinth. 15.5, &amp;c. but in the act of his aſcenſion, Act. 1.9. <hi>While they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight:</hi> And, <hi>they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven, as he went up,</hi> verſ. 10. They ſtood <hi>gazing up into heaven,</hi> and they did ſee him <hi>go into heaven,</hi> verſ. 11.</p>
               <p>If any one be ſo curious to enquire, in what poſture Chriſt was ſeen aſcending; I think it is pointed at, Luk. 24. ver. 50, &amp;c. <hi>He lift up his hands, and bleſſed them: And it came to paſſe, while he bleſſed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven:</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, it is improbable, but divers of the Diſciples or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who ſaw Chriſts aſcending, might, and would have ſought and looked for him; but that they were, in a ſort, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by two Angels, who told them, That Chriſt was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them into heaven, Act. 1.11. and therefore it was vain to ſeek him any longer on the earth. And moſt certain it is, that when the ſonnes of the Prophets ſaw Elijah ſnatcht up, and Eliſhah parting Jordan with Elijahs mantle; they ſaid unto Eliſhah, <hi>There be with thy ſervants fiftie ſonnes of ſtrength; let them go, we pray thee, and ſeek thy maſter,</hi> 2.

                  <hi>They live, ſince their tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpiritually, and not as they were wont to do on earth: their bodies and fleſh are ſpirituall, having no need to be fed by ravens; but are nouriſhed by other ſpirituall food.</hi> If the Jeſuit will grant they have ſpirituall bodies, he will let fall his poſition, and the poſition of his fellows, That Enoch and Elias ſhall die.</p>
               <p>I reaſſume the interrupted point, concerning Paradiſe; <hi>Which,</hi> Cornelius ſaith, <hi>was taken away by the floud;</hi> and, <hi>The place continueth not,</hi> ſaith Pererius; directly contradicting Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: and with Pererius ſtand Salmeron, Sa, Del Rio, and many other. I will help them to this argument: If Paradiſe did, and doth continue on earth, as it was then; Noah, and his familie,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:6913:218"/>and all the beaſts, might with leſſe ado, and more ſoon, have been brought into Paradiſe, and there have lived; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, there being no great diſtance between the place where Paradiſe was, and the abode of Noah when he builded the Ark, if Divines aim right. If Paradiſe had been on earth in Chriſts time, would not Chriſt once have gone into it? Or would the Angels, or could they have kept Chriſt out? Much, very much more might be ſaid; but Salianus hath ſaved me all that labour, who, pag. 66. of the firſt tome of his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Annals, writeth thus,
<note n="x" place="margin">Ridiculum eſt exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimare, Paradiſum eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in aëre ſupremo; aut in lunae concavo collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care: codémque flumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quae in terris viſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, transferre.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a folly to think that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe is in the higheſt part of the aëriall orb; or to place it by the moon. The rivers mentioned to be in Paradiſe, are on earth: how ſhall wee convey, or tranſchange them to thoſe places?</hi> And it is eaſier to ſay, then to prove, that the Angels kept Paradiſe from being overthrown with waters.</p>
               <p>Thus doth he reconcile thoſe, which ſaid, Paradiſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and thoſe, who deny it; with a true and good diſtinction, as I conceive it, in this manner: <hi>Let us ſay that the region and ſoil, the MATERIALE PARADISI, the place of Paradiſe, is yet extant; for ONE GENERATION PASSETH AWAY, AND ANOTHER GENERATION COMETH; B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T THE EARTH ABIDETH FOR EVER, Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 1.4. <hi>For, HE LAYD THE FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND ATIONS OF THE EARTH, THAT IT SHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LD NOT BE REMOVED FOR EVER, Pſal.</hi> 104.5. <hi>Again, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>verſ.</hi> 90. <hi>THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> HAST EST ABLISHED THE EARTH, AND IT ABIDETH.</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>The place is not farre diſtant from Euphrates, and Tigris. But the delicacies, trees, elegancie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, order and diſtribution, ordained for innocencie, are decayed; that it is not to be wondred at, if we cannot finde ſo much as the footſteps of them:</hi> So he. <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſaith Eugubinus, <hi>as Jeruſalem, and Sion the mountain of God, and the Ark of God; ſo Eden alſo
<note n="y" place="margin">Vetuſtate contabuit.</note> is grown writhled and wrinkled with age;</hi> He doth well to add, <hi>Perhaps;</hi> for indeed, it is more likely, that it was not <hi>pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latim,</hi> but ſuddenly, and wholly defaced, when the Angels left the cuſtodie of it, when the floud waſhed away its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bemired it, juſt like to other places.
<note n="z" place="margin">Paradiſus quoad eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiam, non quood or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, quem olim ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit, ſupereſt.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſame ground and the eſſentiall place on which Paradiſe was ſeated, remayneth ſtill: the beauty, adornation, and delight is vaniſhed, ſaith Del Rio: And the beddes of the rivers are changed; and the fountains break forth in other places; as Gregorius de Valentia well collecteth.</hi> Thus farre, excellently, Salianus.</p>
               <p>Now, as I have approved him for ſaying,
<note n="a" place="margin">Simpliciter fateamur; iſtum Paradiſum pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè nullum eſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſe, That that garden of God, is now no where; the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary beauty and commodities are vaniſhed; though the ground thereof yet remaineth:</hi> ſo have I juſt cauſe to laugh more at him, then he did at his fellows for their opinions; ſince he is ſo ſtrangely conjecturall, as to ſay, <hi>We may ſay that Enoch and

                  <hi>he hath whatſoever is naturall;</hi> but to delight in company is naturall; therefore he muſt needs enjoy it. The great S. Auguſtine, perhaps, met with the ſame place; I am ſure theſe are his words, <hi>De Civit.</hi> 19.3.

                  <hi>They ſay that an happy life is a ſociable life; which loveth the welfarre of friends as it doth its own good, and wiſheth as well to others as to it ſelf.</hi> Ludovicus Vives, on the place, ſaith, <hi>They were the Stoicks, who ſaid ſo:</hi> but I rather gueſſe, they were the Peripateticks; and Ariſtotle, their cheif Chaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Which bleſſed life the heathen meaned not of eternall bleſſednes after the reſurrection, but of a bleſſed naturall life in this world, and on this earth: ſuch an one cannot Enoch and Elias have, though they were in Paradiſe; becauſe they have no more companie of their kinde. Enoch, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, had leſſe happines, by this argument (if he be ſuppoſed to be in the earthly Paradiſe) becauſe he was long by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ere Elias came to him; by the ſpace, I ſay, of above two thouſand yeares.</p>
               <p>To the further illuſtration of the former point, I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, If Adam and Eve had lived in Paradiſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, without any other companie, at any other time; I ſhould not much have envied, or wiſhed that felicitie; yea, though he had not fallen, whereby he became <hi>Radix Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> in the phraſe of Auguſtine. Yea, ſuch a bleſſednes there is in communication of happines; that the all-bleſſed, onely-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ever-bleſſed Deitie of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie</hi> would not be without the conjoyned happines of the <hi>Trinitie:</hi> The <hi>ſinglenes of Nature</hi> would not be without the <hi>pluralitie of Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, do they ſee thoſe men and women, and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who now live in the bounds of old Eden, whileſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their bodies, are inviſible?</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:6913:219"/>
               <p>Fourthly, here is a multiplying of miracles daily; that Angels ſhall keep them, yet ſo, that they cannot be ſeen. From Enochs aſſumption, which is now above 4000 yeares ſince, have Angels kept him, that he hath not been once ſeen?</p>
               <p>Beſides, no one place of Scripture Canonicall ſaith, they are in Paradiſe: and it is ſo farre from a favour, as it is rather a durance and captivitie, if they be kept from all other parts of the world, within the bounds of old Paradiſe; ſince many places are now more delightfull then the place or places whereabouts Salianus himſelf now holdeth Paradiſe to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. Moreover, Elijah was taken up <hi>into heaven.</hi> Suppoſe that to gratifie Bellarmine, we grant, <hi>Coelum aerium</hi> is there meant: yet muſt he needs be taken up from the earth, and ſo not abide on earth, in the circuit of old Paradiſe, as Salianus fooliſhly conceiveth.

                     </gap>terra</hi> had been more pithie. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was tranſlated,</hi> Heb. 11.5. was he left on the ſame earth, on which he was before? Or, after he was in heaven did he come again on the earth? It was an excellent and true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our learned Whitaker, That Bellarmine ſometimes confuting his fellows anſwers, confuteth farre better anſwers then himſelf bringeth. And I will be bold to ſay of Salianus, though he doth juſtly deride them, who make Paradiſe in the aire, as Cornelius à Lapide, and Bellarmine; or in the orb of the Moon, as others: Yet his crotchet is as fooliſh, as any of theirs. For, in what part of Paradiſe were they kept when the floud was? or was not all the earth overflown? The Angels then kept them in the aire; or elſe, by an other miracle, kept the water from over-flowing that place. That the Angels kept people from entring into Paradiſe, I have read: that they kept any from going out of it, and kept them in it, I have not read.
<note n="k" place="margin">Nemiui conſpicul eſſe poſſunt.</note> 
                  <hi>None can ſee them,</hi> ſaith Salianus: They may (ſay I) by the ſame divine power by which they are inviſible; if inviſible they be. Can they be ſeen by none? How was Elias ſeen by our Saviour, and his three Diſciples, at the Transfiguration? Or were all they within Paradiſe? or was Elias out of the bounds of the old Paradiſe, when Chriſt was transfigured on the mount? But theſe and greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences muſt theſe men run into, who will maintain againſt Scripture, that Enoch and Elias are in earthly or aeriall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: that they may uphold an other crotchet worſe then this; namely, That Enoch and Elias ſhall hereafter die, and be ſlain by Antichriſt; and are not

                  <hi>in the higheſt heaven,</hi> which is the laſt queſtion.</p>

               <p n="6">6. Let us ſpeak of them ſeverally, then joyntly. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Enoch, the firſt of them who were <hi>rapti,</hi> it ſeemeth to me, that the Apoſtles words, Heb. 11.5. not onely do reach home to that point, unto which before I applyed them, <hi>viz.</hi> That Enoch died not: but evince alſo that he ſhall never die. For it is not ſaid, <hi>Enoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould not die for a good while;</hi> but <hi>he was tranſlated, that he ſhould not,</hi> or <hi>might not ſee death:</hi> Therefore he cannot, he ſhall not die hereafter; ſince the holy Ghoſt hath expreſſed, and ſigned out the end of his tranſlation, <hi>Nè videret mortem, That he ſhould not ſee death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some may anſwer to that place of the Apoſtle, firſt, <hi>that he ſpeaketh of THE DEATH OF SINNERS: as if he had meant, with the book of

<note n="l" place="margin">Improbi, dum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt, mortui ſunt.</note> WICKED MEN, EVEN WHILE THEY LIVE, ARE DEAD;</hi> So farre Druſius. To whom let me adde, that Chriſt ſaith, Luke 9.60. <hi>Let the dead bury their dead.</hi> And 1. Timoth. 5.6. <hi>She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead whileſt ſhe liveth.</hi> And to the Angel of the Church of Sardis, the Spirit ſaith, Revel. 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead.</hi> In all which places wicked men are taken for <hi>the dead:</hi> yet in the place of the Apoſtle it cannot be ſo: for he was ſpeaking of the true lives and deaths of Gods Saints. And if the <hi>literall ſenſe</hi> can be admitted, we muſt not flee to the <hi>myſterie:</hi> but here is no inconvenience in the <hi>letter.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the ſame God, who mercifully placed him in the ſtate of Grace, could as eaſily have kept him ſo, without inflicting death on him. Laſtly, the Apoſtle ſaid, Hebr. 11.4. <hi>Abel is dead;</hi> and then deſcending to Noah and Abraham, at the 13. verſe, <hi>Theſe all died in faith.</hi> I hope no man will ſay, the word <hi>died</hi> is here taken for <hi>ſinned:</hi> but it is taken literally, that their ſouls were parted from their bodies: So the words, <hi>That he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> prove that Enochs ſoul was not parted from his bodie. Indeed he is one of them that are mentioned between Abel and Abraham; but yet ſingled out by expreſſe words, That <hi>he was tranſlated, leſt he ſhould,</hi> or <hi>might ſee death:</hi> and therefore he is exempted out of the compaſſe of that word <hi>All,</hi> by ſpeciall diſpenſation; and onely Abel, Noah, Abraham, are the <hi>All</hi> there meant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith Druſius in his Preface, <hi>It may be ſaid, the Apoſtle ſpake
<note n="m" place="margin">De morte calamita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; agritudinum; ut ſententia ſit, Nè videret mortem, hoc eſt, ea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoda, quae mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6913:220"/>
                  <hi>Enoch was tranſlated leſt he ſhould ſee death,</hi> that is, <hi>leſt he ſhould be continually ſick;</hi> and, <hi>that he might not feel the diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which accompany death.</hi> Secondly, that opinion leadeth Enoch to death, but not the dolorous way to it: which indeed rather beggeth the queſtion, then proveth any thing againſt me. Laſtly, there is no circumſtance inducing us to think, that the Apoſtle, by the word <hi>death,</hi> aimed at the large and extended ſignification of it, for <hi>calamities,</hi> or <hi>ſicknes.</hi> Sure, about Enoch his time, there were no ſuch notable calamities upon the Saints: and the generations of the world were then ſtrong and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſaith Druſius in the ſame place, <hi>It may be ſaid, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch died not; becauſe the Scripture, when it mentioneth his rapture, mentioneth not his death: ſo the Jews ſay, Jacob is not dead; becauſe the Scripture uſeth the word of EXPIRING, not of DYING.</hi> This is ridiculous; for, what is <hi>expiring,</hi> but <hi>dying?</hi> Geneſ. 49.33. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob yeelded up the ghoſt, and was gathered unto his people:</hi> doth not either of theſe phraſes, do not both evince that he died? Oh, but the Jews ſay, <hi>Jacob non eſt mortuus;</hi> I am ſure, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Hebr. 11.21. ſpeaking of Jacob, ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as he was dying, he bleſſed his children;</hi> or, <hi>when he was a dying,</hi> as it is in our laſt tranſlation. It evinceth, he died within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And I am ſure again, that Chriſt, Luke 20.37. from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Moſes, proveth, that Jacob died. I am alſo ſure, that S. Stephen ſaith, Act. 7.15. <hi>Jacob went down into Egypt, and died.</hi> Surely theſe crotchets of misbeleeving Jews ſhould not have the leaſt countenance againſt pregnant proofs both of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Druſius yet inforceth this third anſwer, thus; <hi>The ſame Apoſtle ſaith of Melchiſedech, Heb.</hi> 7.3. <hi>HE WAS WITHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T FATHER, WITHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T MOTHER, WITHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T DESCENT, HAVING NEITHER BEGINNING OF DAYES, NOR END OF LIFE. Wherefore? without doubt, becauſe in Scripture there is no mention of his parents, and kindred, of his birth, or of his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. Firſt, If it be ſaid of all, whoſe progenitours, iſſues, kindreds, birth, and death, are unrevealed in Scripture, <hi>that they were without father, mother, deſcent, having neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes nor end of life;</hi> we ſhould have many, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Melchiſedechs in thoſe reſpects; Demetrius the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſmith, and Alexander the copperſmith, and troups of the wicked; Daniel, Sidrach, Miſach, and Abednego; Nathanael, and Joſeph of Arimathea; S. Mark, and S. Luke, and divers others. For, what mention is there of their parents, their children, their genealogies, their birth-dayes, or of their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, in the ſacred Writ? Therefore theſe words may be ſaid of Melchiſedech, without any reference at all to that reaſon:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6913:221"/>and the words may not be ſaid of others, though the divine Scripture omitteth as much, as it did of Melchiſedech.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we grant, that it is in part the reaſon, why he is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>without a father,</hi> &amp;c. yet it may be ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe no other record, before S. Pauls time, no ſacred or profane Authour, no tradition, no book Apocryphall, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his parents, or iſſue (ſo farre as yet appeareth:) And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe S. Paul, who knew the names of Jannes and Jambres ſome ſuch way, or by revelation immediate, and by no ſuch way knew Melchiſedechs pedegree, he might ſay as he did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Eraſmus ſaith, <hi>Melchiſedech came of obſcure parents, not worthy to be named.</hi> Before him, Euſtatius Antiochenus ſaid the ſame: and perhaps it may be a reaſon why David called his Nephews, Joab and Abiſhai, <hi>the ſonnes of Zeruiah,</hi> 2. Samuel, 19.22. (for Zeruiah was Davids own ſiſter, 1. Chron. 2.16.) and omitted their father, for his unworthineſſe; yea, the Divine hiſtorie, where David is ſilent, often mentioneth Joab and Abiſhai, with the addition of their mothers name; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes omitteth the fathers name. This I cannot think to be Melchiſedechs caſe: for being a King, and ſo glorious a Prieſt, both in one; it is moſt unlikely, that he had obſcure and poore parents: yet he might deſcend from curſed Cham; as well as Chriſt, from Moabitiſh Ruth, or from Rahab the harlot of Canaan.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Jews ſay, <hi>He was a baſtard:</hi> But it is ſooner ſaid, then proved; for never baſtard attained as called by God, to thoſe two higheſt conjoyned titles, of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men have thought him to be Noah; and more, to be Sem, Noahs ſonne; as ſome Jews; Lyra, and Abulenſis: when indeed he can be neither.

                  <hi>Some very fooliſhly think that Sem was Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> (ſaith Procopius:) <hi>But that is impoſsible: for when I ſet down his genealogie, it appeareth that he lived not to the time of Terah, or Thara,</hi> Geneſis 11.24. So he: who hitteth the truth, that Melchiſedech was not Sem: but is out in the genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; for both Noah and Sem lived in Abrahams time. See Cornelius à Lapide, on the Hebrews; and the learned Helvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. <hi>Noah,</hi> ſaith Helvicus, <hi>died the</hi> 57 <hi>yeare of Abraham; and Sem out-lived Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That neither Noah nor Sem could be Melchiſedech, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable from Hebr. 7.6. Melchiſedechs deſcent, or pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is not counted, ſaith the Apoſtle, Hebr. 7. from Levi, or Abraham, or their Progenitours, who came from Arphaxad, the ſonne of Sem, the ſonne of Noah. Secondly, both Noah, and Sem, and their genealogie and generations, are perfectly and exactly ſet down: but Melchiſedech is without deſcent, or pedegree, or genealogie, Hebr. 7.3. <hi>as undeſcribed,</hi> ſay they. Thirdly, we know, Sems father was Noah; Noahs father was
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6913:221"/>Lamech; but Melchiſedechs father is not known. Fourthly, Noah died, Geneſ. 9.29. and Sem lived not 603 yeares, as it is apparent, Geneſ. 11.10, &amp;c. Helvicus maketh his death fall on his ſix hundredth yeare; but there is no end known of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedechs dayes. Origen, in likelihood, fore-ſeeing the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences accompanying the fore-recited, and commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, inventeth a new trick, That Melchiſedech was an Angel. After him ran Didymus. But no Angel was ever a temporall earthly King: no Angel was ever a Prieſt, offering up bread and wine, and receiving tithes; or had an order of Prieſthood annexed to any of them: no Angel had ever pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from Abraham, or any other. But Melchiſedech, though he had none at all from Abraham or his aſcendents, none at all mentioned in any authentick records or tradition; yet had he one or other; of which hereafter.</p>

This Arch-heretick had other Melchiſedechians, who taught, that Melchiſedech was a certain vertue, or power, greater then Chriſt; becauſe Chriſt is ſaid to be a Prieſt according to his order: So Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius relateth, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 55.

               </p>
               <p>Some have held, that Chriſt was a Prieſt according alſo to the order of Aaron; and then, by that argument, the Aaronicall Prieſthood ſhould be better then Chriſts; which is plainly confuted in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews. Chriſt accompliſhed every type of him, and according as they ſignified, did he fulfill: This doth not prove their betternes, or efficacie, greater then his: no more doth his being a Prieſt according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchiſedech, either magnifie Melchiſedech above Chriſt, or any way vilifie Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Varietie of conjectures have been manifold; I hold it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bableſt, with Joſephus the Jew, with divers late Writers, with the ancient Fathers,

And this God might ordain purpoſely, that the Gentiles might not deſpair of ſalvation: but, though Chriſt came of the ſeed of Abraham, and the Jews were Gods peculiar people; yet Chriſt himſelf was a Prieſt according to the order of Melchiſedech, who deſcended from the curſed ſeed.</p>
               <p>That Melchiſedech was the holy Ghoſt, was a mad opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, now forſaken of all. That he was not an Angel, nor a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue greater then Chriſt, I proved before: but a man, a meer
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:6913:222"/>man: whoſe pedigree is not to be reckoned from Abraham, or his predeceſſours: for Abrahams predeceſſours dwelt in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the Caldees,</hi> Geneſ. 11.28, and 31. and, <hi>Your fathers dwelt on the other ſide of the floud in old time,</hi> Joſhuah 24.2. that is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Euphrates Eaſtward, even unto the Eaſt-Indies, did Sems poſteritie reach and multiply; propagating true religion, with the hiſtories both of the Creation, and of the Deluge. In the Eaſt-Indian <hi>Shaſter</hi> (which is the Canon of their devotion, eſteemed by them, as the ſacred Bible is by us) there are now many fables intermixed, ſavouring more of humane invention, then of faith: yet their rationall traditions make nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the divine truth, concerning the creation, then the more ignorant Theologie of the Romanes, till Chriſts time; and as good laws and precepts have the Eaſt-Indians, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, and government Oecomenick and Politicall, if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for a ſettled State. And I hold it a moſt remarkable thing, that the Eaſt-Indian language, to this day, hath farre more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie with the Hebrew, then any one of our Occidentall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; yea, then all of them put together. And thoſe <hi>Indi Aurorae,</hi> or, as one calleth them, <hi>Indi Diei,</hi> have ſcarce a word, but it is found in the Caldee, Arabick, or primitive Hebrew: and by perfect knowledge in the Hebrew, one may eaſily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge of all other the Eaſtern tongues. Whence we may conclude the prioritie of the Hebrew tongue. See the learned William Poſtell, in his alphabet of twelve tongues, different in characters: and more ſpecially <hi>de Indica lingua.</hi> One great errour I cannot omit in the ſaid learned Poſtellus, in his Tractate <hi>de lingua Samaritana;</hi> for, from S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, <hi>in prooemio libri Regum,</hi> and with him, he maintaineth, that it is certain that Eſdras, after the inſtauration of the temple under Zerubbabel, invented other letters, which now we uſe; and that the characters of the Samaritans and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews were all one till then: and withall, himſelf found out a very probable ſpecious reaſon, why Eſdras ſhould forſake the old characters, and framed new: and yet he bringeth in the characters of Hebrew now in uſe, as delivered by God in the tables given to Moſes: whereas (if he would be conſtant to himſelf) either God gave to Moſes the Samaritan letters, and Eſdras invented new ones: or, if God gave theſe now in uſe to Moſes, the Samaritans may be thought to invent new cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that they might differ from the Hebrews, and make their ſchiſm more irreconcileable, by the ſtrangneſſe of misfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured letters. Moſes was farre more ancient then Eſdras; and the Samaritans, who received no Scripture but Moſes his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in all likelihood uſed the letters and characters uſed by Moſes: and ſo, in concluſion it will ariſe, that the Samaritan let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Hebrew were all one a long time; which Poſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6913:222"/>confeſſeth: and that they were exactly the ſame which God gave to Moſes; which Poſtellus denieth: and after that, Eſdras might invent new characters, upon the ground which Poſtellus framed, and the Jews (as he ſaith) approved: and theſe commonly we enjoy. I cannot omit, that you ſhall finde other characters of the alphabet of that language which was uſed beyond Euphrates, different from the Samaritan, but more from the Hebrew: And it is in the Hebrew Grammar of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham de Balmis,

               <p>I am come back to Jeruſalem, where Melchiſedech reigned. And though he was a moſt holy man, and an extraordinary type of Chriſt; yet, I ſay, he came of the curſed ſeed. For Cham poſſeſſed all Canaan; and it was called the land of Canaan, from Canaan the ſonne of Cham. And he was one of the Kings in that land: for it had many Kings, Geneſ. 14. Melchiſedech, and Job, and many other, in the old Teſtament, do prove, that God was not the God of the Jews onely, but alſo of the Gentiles.</p>

               <p>So farre Druſius in the preface to his book called <hi>Henoch.</hi> But this is no good expoſition, ſince God took away by death all the reſt of the Patriarchs, as well as Enoch; and yet it is moſt ſingularly ſpoken of Enoch, <hi>He was not found, for God took him. By death,</hi> ſaith the ſhallow Jew: but our divine Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was tranſlated, that he might not ſee death.</hi> What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or rationall man will doubt, but we are to incline to the Apoſtle?</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:6913:223"/>
               <p>Again, the third anſwer brought by Druſius (againſt his own opinion, as himſelf profeſſeth) to prove, that <hi>VIDERE MORTEM, To ſee death,</hi> doth not ſignifie to die a naturall death, where there is a true ſeparation of the ſoul from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: and that, <hi>NON VIDERE MORTEM, Not to ſee death,</hi> on the contrary, doth not ſignifie To be kept alive from death, (which I, with Druſius, do ſay, was the true intent of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) draweth to this head, <hi>Enoch ſaw not death, that is, died not; becauſe the holy Scriptures, where they make mention of his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, mention not his death.</hi> I anſwer, If all were true, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that Enoch is dead, or ſhall die; which is the point queſtioned.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if Enoch were dead, or to die; the wiſdome of the Divine Inſpirer, would never have ſingled out ſuch a phraſe, among ſo many other thouſand, as ſhould leade men to think the clean contrary. <hi>He was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death.</hi> For there reſteth the period. If it had been meant, he ſhould die; it would have been added, <hi>He ſhould not ſee death, for a long time;</hi> or, <hi>He ſhould not ſee death, till toward the end of the world;</hi> or the like. But, <hi>He was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death;</hi> Therefore he ſhall never ſee death.</p>
               <p>Suarez, <hi>in tertiam partem ſummae, quaeſt.</hi> 59. <hi>artic.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. ſaith directly, <hi>S. Paul meaned, that Enoch ſhould not die in that place, into which he was tranſlated.</hi> True; But why ſhould he die in any other place? or indeed why ſhould he die at all, who, above other men, was rapted purpoſely, <hi>That he might not ſee death?</hi> Surely, the deferring of death, for a time, is not ſo great a favour; The exempting one wholly from death, is a bleſſing, above ordinary. Again, it is ſaid of Enoch, Geneſ. 5.23. <hi>All his dayes were</hi> 365. (where <hi>dayes</hi> are taken for <hi>yeares,</hi> as otherwhere in Scripture:) But theſe are not all his dayes, if either he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one place of the earth into an other, (which Salia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus fondly imagined) or live now in a mortall corruptible bodie.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of our bleſſed Saviour, Hebr. 5.7. He poured out prayers <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh;</hi> that is, whileſt he lived on earth the life of nature, in an elementary, terrene, humane, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive bodie. And of ſome other Patriarchs, <hi>All the dayes of</hi> them were ſuch, and ſuch, Geneſ. 5.17, 20, &amp;c. that is, all the dayes while they breathed on the earth the breath of life in mortall bodies. Therefore even from the very phraſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Enoch, <hi>All his dayes were</hi> 365. we may inferre, He lived not in a mortall bodie any longer on the earth, He liveth not now any where in a mortall bodie.</p>
               <p>Somewhat muſt I ſay alſo of Elias ſeverally. Rabbi Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, on the 5 of Geneſ. ſaith, <hi>When Elijah was hurried up in a fiery chariot, his bodie was burnt up of that fire:</hi> and, <hi>Other Jews
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6913:223"/>agree with him,</hi> ſaith

I think, the cloke might have been burnt, as well as his bodie; and Eliſhah could not have eſcaped ſcorching, when the fire parted them. Again, the aſhes might have fallen, as well as his mantle. And the Jew would account it no great favour, to be burnt alive. That fire, certainly, was rather <hi>conſervative,</hi> then <hi>deſtructive:</hi> not <hi>penal,</hi> and <hi>conſuming,</hi> as the fire from heaven drawn down by Elias, 2. Kings, 1.12. not <hi>punitive,</hi> and <hi>conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> as the fire of hell, <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> Matth. 25.41. <hi>

Adam lived to ſee Methuſelah; Methuſelah was alive in Sems time: Sem died not till Jacob was born: Jacob li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till Amram Moſes his father was born: Amram expired not till Ahijah the Shilonite lived: Ahijah lived with Elijah: Elijah ſhall live till the end of the world: Therefore they thought Elijah was not burnt, is not dead. But firſt, the Papiſts themſelves ſay, that Elijah ſhall be ſlain by Antichriſt, before the end of world: Therefore this maketh not for them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Jews might have tucked up the time ſhorter, on this faſhion: Adam lived in the dayes of Enoch; and Enoch to the end of the world. And ſo their number of ſeven might be reduced unto two. But let us leave theſe Rabbinicall ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Elijah; and ſay ſomewhat of him, not as he was in a Paradiſe of phanſie, but as he was with our bleſſed Saviour on the mount, at that glorious transfiguration. And this I ſet down for certain; No paſſage in the Goſpels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth demonſtratively, that his bodie was immortall. It is true,

               <p>Secondly, I confeſſe, Abraham, Dives, and Lazarus are ſo called, though their bodies were ſeparated then from them. Yet let Del Rio give me a Scripture inſtance, where ever any one man or humane ſoul in an aeriall bodie, is called that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whoſe ſoul it is. The triviall objection of Samuel I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely balk (becauſe I am ſo farre flown out alreadie) ſtanding upon this, that either true Samuel appeared not; or, if he did, he appeared in his own bodie.</p>
               <p>The queſtion which Alexander asked of the firſt man of the Gymnoſophiſts, was, Whether the dead or the living made the greater number? He anſwered, The living: For the dead (ſaid he) are no more men. The reaſon of his anſwer, is grounded on theſe Aphoriſmes; That the ſoul is not man: That the bodie is not man: That both ſoul and bodie do concurre to make a man. Neither doth Chriſts divine reaſon contradict any part of this, when he avoucheth, That God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. For Chriſt ſpake of the ſouls onely, or of ſouls which ſhould have bodies at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and the Gymnoſophiſt, of men conſiſting of ſouls and bodies, who are properly to be termed living men: whereas ſeparated ſouls, though living, are not truly living men.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6913:224"/>horſeman is not the man and the horſe, but the man onely: yet he is called an horſeman, in reference to the riding of his horſe.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus Vives cometh in like a buſie bodie; and he, from Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Marcellus, and Servius; and they, from Ennius and Virgil, will maintain that an <hi>horſeman</hi> is taken for an <hi>horſe;</hi> and an <hi>horſe,</hi> called an <hi>horſeman.</hi> I anſwer, Virgil followed Ennius his antique phraſe; and both of them Poeticall licence. But Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro uſed proper Philoſophicall terms; whileſt their language is improper, and in it ſelf both abſurd and untrue. S. Auguſtine out of Varro ſtill proceedeth; <hi>Or whether the bodie onely be the man; being ſemblable to the ſoul, as the cup is to the potion: For the cup, and the potion contained in the cup, are not together called the cup: but the cup onely is called a cup, becauſe it is fit to hold the potion.</hi> Vives here again cometh in with his over-nice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and criticiſm:
<note n="b" place="margin">Eſt etiam poculum id quod potatur, praeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine apud poctas.</note> 
                  <hi>That which men drink</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is termed a cup, eſpecially by the Poets:</hi>
                  <q>Poculáque inventis Acheloia miſcuit uvis:</q> his meaning being, that <hi>he did mingle wine in the cups of Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loius his framing.</hi> I anſwer, that the <hi>cups</hi> in that place, are exactly diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>wine</hi> in them, and are not taken <hi>(quatenus pocula)</hi> for the liquor in them. Secondly, if any one hath at any time ſo uſed the word; it is Metaphorically, and not in proprietie of language. For he could not mingle wine <hi>with,</hi> but <hi>in</hi> the cups: nor did he properly mingle the cups with the wine.</p>
               <p>I paſſe from the ſecond interruption of Vives, to S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, out of Varro ſtill; <hi>Or whether neither ſoul alone, nor bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die alone, but both togeher, be man: of which man one part is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoul or the bodie; but he wholly conſiſteth of both, to be a man: as we call two horſes joyned together BIG AS; whereof either is part of the pair or couple; but neither is the pair or couple, but both harneſſed together.</hi> In the end, <hi>Varro reſolveth,</hi> ſaith S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, <hi>That neither the ſoul, nor the bodie, but both ſoul and bodie together is the man. And ſo the chief bleſſedneſſe of man conſiſteth in the good both of ſoul and bodie.</hi> Which opinion is a divine truth; and S. Auguſtine approveth it, as may be gathered by his whole diſcourſe, and by the beginning of the fifth chap. of that book. So it was not the true Moſes, unleſſe the very ſoul and the very bodie of Moſes were preſent.</p>
               <p>Yet Aquinas, 3. <hi>part. quaeſt.</hi> 45. thinketh that Moſes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in his own bodie: which Suarez confuteth by theſe authorities; S. Hierom, on Matth. 17. S. Auguſtine, <hi>de Mirab. ſacrae Scripturae,</hi> 3.10. which is followed by Sotus, <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>ſenten. diſtinct.</hi> 43. Hieronymus Natalis the Jeſuit, thinks he ſtrikes all ſure: for amongſt his curious coſtly pictures upon the foure Goſpels, he picturing out the transfiguration of our Saviour, bringeth in Moſes with horns on his head; to deſigne, that it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6913:225"/>was the ſame Moſes, and the ſame bodie which Moſes had on the mount; according to the Vulgat, Exod. 34.29. <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Moſes quòd cornuta eſſet facies ſua:</hi> that is, according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis his opinion, <hi>Moſes knew not that he had horns:</hi> and verſ. 30. <hi>Viderunt filii Iſrael cornutam faciem Moſis:</hi> that is, according to the ſame mans phanſie, <hi>The Iſraelites ſaw Moſes his horns:</hi> though intruth the words may be farre better tranſlated.

                  <hi>It is very credible, that the dead bodie of Moſes

And Moſes himſelf died privately: and was buried ſecretly: no man ſaw him dying or dead. I acknowledge that ſome of the Ancients have inclined to this, <hi>viz,</hi> that Moſes his face did ſhine all his life time, when he ſpake to the people. So Ambroſe, <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 118.

And our late tranſlation ſeemeth in part to accord, Exod. 34.33. <hi>Till Moſes had done ſpeaking with them, he put a vail on his face:</hi> Yet the word <hi>Till,</hi> is not in the originall: but it may be probably expounded, That when Moſes had done ſpeaking, he put a vail on his face (for ſo the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine runne:) And though Moſes ordinarily put off the vail, when he went to ſpeak with God; and put it on, when he returned: yet once, and at the firſt of all, he might ſpeak unto the people with face open, for more reverence and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obſervation is from Origen, <hi>Homil.</hi> 12. <hi>in Exod. circa medium;</hi> and it is a good one. <hi>In the Law</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Moſes his face was glorified, though vailed: but his hand put into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome WAS LEAPRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S AS SNOW, Exod.</hi> 4.6.

               <p>Furthermore, that there is no abſolute neceſſitie, that either Moſes or Elias (though they were ſeen in glorie) had immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and impaſſible bodies by the transfiguration, appeareth by this, That our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, after that his transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, had a mortall bodie, and did die: eſpecially, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that his glorie was greater then theirs; as the <hi>Maſters</hi> is above the <hi>Servants;</hi> and the <hi>Lords,</hi> above the <hi>Attendants.</hi>

               <p>Now as I have clearely declared my judgement, that it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not demonſtratively from any <hi>puncto,</hi> that Elias at the transfiguration had an unchangeably glorious eſtate of bodie: ſo I hold it very probable, that Elias did never die properly; but was changed at his rapture; and, at his ingreſſe into heaven, enjoyed a truly glorified bodie; and both unto the time of Chriſts transfiguration, and then, and ever ſince enjoyeth, and liveth in fleſh incorruptible; not <hi>Animall,</hi> but <hi>Spirituall,</hi> as the bleſſed Saints ſhall have after the end of the world.</p>
               <p>If any one think to choke me with my former words, That Chriſts glorie was greater then the glorie of his ſervants; And therefore, if Elias had an immortall bodie, Chriſt muſt have one alſo; which he had not: I anſwer, That the hypoſtaticall union of the Divine Nature to the Humane in Chriſt, was at all times of greater glorie, then the glorified eſtate of the Saints ſhall be after the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as <hi>intenſively</hi> Chriſts glorie was greater then Elijahs, though it was eclipſed by Chriſts voluntarie conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, that he might accompliſh the work of our redemption: ſo <hi>extenſively,</hi> at the inſtant of the transfiguration, I doubt not, but the bodily glorie of Chriſt was as farre above his ſervants glorie, as the light of the ſunne ſurpaſſeth the light of leſſer
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6913:226"/>ſtarres. Therefore, all things conſidered, Chriſts bodily glorie was greater then Elijahs, though Elijahs was <hi>immortall,</hi> and Chriſts then <hi>changeable</hi> and <hi>mortall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmine, in his Apologie againſt the judicious Monitorie preface of King James, eſteemeth it as
<note n="p" place="margin">Valde admirandum.</note> 
                  <hi>much to be admired at,</hi> that the learned King ſaid, <hi>Enoch and Elias are now glorified in heaven.</hi> Many things indeed might Bellarmine learn by his Majeſtie, which are <hi>&amp; laudanda, &amp; valde admiranda, both to be praiſed and wondred at:</hi> but, taking <hi>valde admirandum</hi> in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſenſe, I ſay, his wonder is full of ignorance and malice. Wherefore, omitting much of what that really-unanſwerable Biſhop hath copiouſly alledged, I ſay, It is no ſuch ſtrange matter; to ſay, or beleeve, that Enoch and Elias have glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodies. And yet here, firſt of all, I will ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that a man, both in ſoul and in a corruptible bodie, may be in the third heaven: becauſe S. Paul elſe might have known, that himſelf was not in the third heaven in his bodie: but his doubting and neſciencie (2. Cor. 12.2, &amp;c. <hi>Whether in the bodie, I cannot tell; or whether out of the bodie, I cannot tell; God knoweth)</hi> proveth that either might have been. The disjunctive might elſe have been ſpared, if it could have been done onely one way: Therefore it is poſſible unto the Almightie, that Elias might or may have a paſſive mortall bodie, though he were rapt into heaven, and there be at this preſent. But, <hi>A poſſe ad eſſe non valet conſequentia:</hi> and the reaſons and authoritie which place Elias in heaven, in an unpaſſible bodie, are more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and numerous, then theirs which embrace the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that Elias went not up into the third heaven, becauſe he was carried up in a whirlwinde: and whirlwindes reach not to the third heaven: I anſwer, By the ſame cavill they may ſay, Our Saviour aſcended not into heaven, when <hi>a cloud received him out of their ſight,</hi> Act. 1.9. becauſe clouds pierce not to the higheſt heaven. But we muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things <hi>ordinarie</hi> and <hi>extraordinarie.</hi> Both the whirlwinde and the cloud had ſomewhat in them above the common le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of nature, and were not meerly elementarie; but adapted to higher and diviner uſes, then common clouds or whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes.</p>
               <p>I remove this paſſant tabernacle of diſcourſe from an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto the ſtanding manſion of our great Adverſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.

                  <hi>They deſcended, with all things that were theirs, alive into hell, as it is in the Hebrew. What is meant by thoſe words, All things? Their Tabernacles, houſes, and goods. But I beleeve, the Papiſts will not ſay, that their houſes and goods deſcended into the place of ſouls; but into the place of bodies. Therefore Moſes denoteth the place of bodies, not of ſouls.</hi> The honoured Doctour might alſo have conſidered, that it may be as well ſaid, that their <hi>bodies</hi> went to <hi>hell,</hi> as their <hi>ſouls</hi> to the <hi>ſepulchre;</hi> if the place of their deſcent had been underſtood onely of the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacles of <hi>bodies,</hi> and not of <hi>ſouls.</hi> Secondly, (as I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) may not as well their bodies go to hell alive, as <hi>they, and all that appertained to them, went down</hi> (as the Seventie in Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus have it) <hi>alive into the pit?</hi> Thirdly, did their tabernacles, houſes, beaſts, and goods go down into their graves? Graves are not the proper places for tents, beaſts and goods? but for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies. Thoſe terms of <hi>locus corporum,</hi> are obſcure; and culled out purpoſely, for a ſtarting-hole: whereas, if he had ſaid, Moſes denoted their ſepulchres onely, and not hell (which he doth in effect afterward;) we may preſſe him with this, That they are much happier then other: for whereas others bring nothing into this world, nor carrie any thing out of it; theſe men went not to hell, in Moſes his meaning; but carried with them, out of this world, their beaſts, their goods, yea their very tents. But their <hi>miſerie</hi> and <hi>curſe extraordinarie</hi> is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and not their <hi>happineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, I could wiſh that the worthy Doctour had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed how divinely the Holy Writ diſcriminateth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matters. Moſes propheſied Numb. 16.30. <hi>If the earth ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit, &amp;c.</hi> where you muſt interpret it, as if he had thus ſaid, <hi>The earth indeed ſhall ſwallow and cover alike both them and all their goods: but the perſons themſelves ſhall go down alive (VIVENTES, living,</hi> as the Interlinearie hath it; <hi>vivi,</hi> as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Raynolds) <hi>lower; even to the pit.</hi> And accordingly it came to paſſe, verſ. 32. <hi>The earth ſwallowed them up, and their houſes, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:6913:228"/>all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods:</hi> where you ſee, the earth ſwallowed all alike; the chief leaders, and their goods; the aſſociates of Korah, and all their goods. Yet for the perſons themſelves, it is ſaid in the next verſe, by way of diſtinction, remarkably; <hi>They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit:</hi> which you cannot poſſibly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret of their goods, and tabernacles: (for they never were alive; and never could go down alive, no not to the grave, or to any pit whatſoever) but of the principals, and the acceſſaries; <hi>viz.</hi> the chief rebels, and their partakers: for diverſe <hi>men</hi> appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, as is apparent verſ. 32. and therefore, what our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlation hath ſomewhat dubiouſly, and ambiguouſly, <hi>They, and all that appertained to them,</hi> (where it is not ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough expreſſed, whether men onely, or men and goods are compriſed under the words) the Interlinearie hath exactly, and truly determined,

<note n="e" place="margin">Locus fuit corporum, non animarum, in quem deſcenderunt Corah, Dathan, &amp; Abiram.</note> 
                  <hi>It was the place of bodies, and not of ſouls, into which Korah, Dathan, and Abiram deſcended:</hi> (as if their ſouls were in the place appointed for bodies) which he further parallelleth with the burying alive of the deflowred Veſtall virgins: though he ought to diſtinguiſh between the extraordinary miraculous hand of God, and the ordinary ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of men in ſuch caſes.

               <p>That Moſes denoteth the place of bodies, I denie not: for even that place is in hell, for all the bodies of the wicked in due time, and for theſe mens bodies, extraordinarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the generall judgement.</p>

               <p>But I am loth to ſay, Moſes meant not the place of ſouls: I am loth to entertain a thought, That the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did repent; for, if they did ſo, they are ſaved: I would be loth to flee from rationable probabilitíe, to poſſibilitie; which hath a farre-ſtretched almightie arm; and to ſay, as he doth,

                  <hi>It may be that ſome of them were not faultie; or, if they were, repented.</hi> That they repented who were ſwallowed up alive, ſeems not agreeable to S.

Compare the words with 2. Pet. 2.12. Moreover, none dares denie the poſſibilitie of repentance; but who can think it probable, That God would ſend ſuch an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie puniſhment on ſuch as were innocent, or repented; when as the children of that Luciferian Arch-rebel Korah, were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from that deſtruction?

                  <hi>If they died in their obſtinacie.</hi> I denie not, but in a large ſenſe, they may be ſaid <hi>to die:</hi> and the Scripture ſaith, They ſhould not <hi>die the common death of all men,</hi> Numb. 16.29. yet alſo, <hi>They deſcended alive into the pit:</hi> which cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reconciled, then to ſay, The ſtate of their bodies was changed; immortalitie ſwallowed up their mortalitie, in the act of their <hi>deſcending,</hi> or <hi>paſsion</hi> rather, if you will ſo call it.

               <p>I would be loth alſo to ſay, That nothing elſe is noted by the words, but that, Whereas others die firſt, and then are buried; theſe men were buried alive, or as live men: that I may paſſe by his amphibolous phraſe,

               <p>The truth and ſumme of all is this; By divine power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, the houſes, or tents, the beaſts, and the goods of Korah and his complices, were ſeparated and ſecluded from the uſe of men; were ſwallowed up, and covered in the earth, and came to that end and deſtruction which they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: No word of God ſaith expreſſely, no inference or reaſon evinceth, no probabilitie induceth us to think, that their tents, houſhold-ſtuffe, or utenſils were alive; or that they, yea, or the beaſts of theſe conſpiratours, went into the graves of them, (if graves they had any;) much leſſe, did ſuch traſh deſcend into hell, that place of <hi>torment,</hi> that <hi>Tophet</hi> prepared for wicked men, that <hi>Deep,</hi> excruciating and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting both the Devil and his Angels.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: but their ſouls could not go into the <hi>graves,</hi> and there reſide; and their bodies might go into <hi>hell,</hi> and there reſide; therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, muſt needes there be expounded, not of the <hi>grave,</hi> nor of <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus corporum</hi> (as Doctour Raynolds phraſeth it) but of the <hi>hell of the damned,</hi> of the <hi>locus animarum;</hi> which place alſo muſt be the receptacle for all humane bodies of the wicked, after the day of doom and retribution; and may be the priſon of thoſe reprobate both ſouls and bodies, whom God miraculouſly thither adjudgeth, as he did this rebellious rout.</p>
               <p>Though Lyra, cited by Doctour Raynolds, thinks the grave is meant, becauſe <hi>it is appointed for all men to die, and after that cometh judgement:</hi> yet I have many wayes proved, that by eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall diſpenſation, and by extraordinarie priviledge, ſome may receive favour, beyond the common rule or courſe of nature: and contrarily, I doubt not, but upon ſo great a commotion, and furious rebellion, God could, and did, by way of exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie puniſhment, puniſh theſe men bodily, before the uſuall time; and ſent their bodies to hell, before the generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If Cajetan, and Hieronymus ab Oleaſtro, cited by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctour, expound <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the <hi>grave;</hi> yet they want both weight and age, to put down Epiphanius, before recited, and many other Ancients, who place their bodies in <hi>hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I accept then of Suarez his confeſſion before mentioned; and agree with him, That Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, are now,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6913:230"/>both in ſouls and bodies, in hell. And upon this ground, I thus work: If they be there, they are there to be puniſhed, and are puniſhed: if they burn in hell-fire, they have no longer mortall bodies: But as at the laſt day, the bodies of the wicked, that are alive then, ſhall put on immortalitie; ſo the bodies of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, were not properly ſeparated from their ſouls; but were changed, and fitted for ſuch places of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the inſtant of their deſcent: and ſo they deſcended alive into the pit of hell.</p>
               <p>Then why may not Enoch and Elias be in immortall and glorified bodies, ſince they were aſſumed up into heaven? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince Suarez himſelf again ingenuouſly confeſſeth,
<note n="k" place="margin">Animae glorioſae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturale eſt uniri cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pori immortali &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſo.</note> 
                  <hi>It is convenient, yea proper to nature, that a glorified ſoul ſhould be united to an immortall and glorified bodie.</hi> And the ſouls of Enoch and Elias are now glorified, by the like acknowledgement of our learned Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Again, where the ſouls of Enoch and Elias are, there alſo are their bodies: But their ſouls are in the higheſt heaven. For our Saviour ſaith, John 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo, whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> And John 12.26. <hi>Where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.</hi> But Chriſt is in the higheſt heavens: Therefore both Enoch and Elias are, with their bodies, in the third heaven: unleſſe you can ſay, They were not given by God to Chriſt, and were not Chriſts ſervants. Now ſince they are there in their bodies; it is very unlikely, that they ſhould be there ſome thouſands of yeares in bodies mortall and unglorified. Hierom, <hi>ad Pammachium,</hi> avoucheth,
<note n="l" place="margin">Fruuntur divino con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortio, &amp; cibo coeleſti.</note> 
                  <hi>They enjoy and have the fruition of the Deitie, and are fed with heavenly food:</hi> which is not meat for mortall bodies.</p>

And Apollinarius fully agreeth with the other, with this addition onely, that Enoch and Elias have now glorified bodies. Dorotheus, <hi>in Synopſi de Elia,</hi> thus,
<note n="m" place="margin">Qui humi iucedebat; inſtar ſpiritus, cum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis in coelis agit.</note> 
                  <hi>Who was on the earth as other men; now, as a ſpirit, liveth in heaven with the Angels:</hi> therefore he hath not a mortall bodie.</p>
               <p>Again, in moſt of the generall promiſes that God hath made, he giveth ſome inſtance or other, to be as it were a taſte of what ſhall ſucceed; leſt mens hearts ſhould fail, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectancie of that, whereof they ſee no kinde of proof. As for example, becauſe it was promiſed, that there ſhall be a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, it was figured, not onely more obſcurely in Iſaac his riſing up from the Altar; in the drawing of Joſeph out of the pit; in the Whales deliverie of Jonah; in Samſons breaking from the cords; in Daniels eſcape from the lions; in the waters yeelding and giving up Moſes, to live in the Kings houſe, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6913:230"/>the like: but more evidently, by the reall, and temporarie rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of divers dead, both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, the glorification of our bodies being determined by God, and by him promiſed; yea, Enoch himſelf prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, that <hi>God cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement upon all,</hi> Jude 14, and 15 verſes; which is not, cannot be executed, without the glorifying of ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his ſervants; we may well think, it pleaſed God to give to the old world a pledge or two of the generall glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bodies of his Saints, by the particular perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame to the bodies of Enoch and Elias, whom he aſſumed up into heaven, by way of eſpeciall favour.</p>
               <p>To this I may adde, That Enoch and Elijahs raptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing types of Chriſts aſcenſion, ſince Chriſt aſcended in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and immortall bodie, the ſhadows muſt be like the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and therefore they aſcended in glorified immortall bodies.</p>
               <p>Suarez is driven to a great exigent: <hi>They were onely</hi> (ſaith he)

                  <hi>in a ſtate in which they might merit and increaſe in grace, till the time in which they were tranſlated: And as they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, they were ſo confirmed in grace, that they can commit no ſinne: And to their old eſtate of meriting ſhall they return, when they ſhall live again amongſt men.</hi> But who ever heard of ſuch turnings and returnings in any other men or Angels? or that their eſtate ſhall be changed from

                  <hi>an eſtate wherein they cannot ſinne, to an eſtate in which they may ſinne?</hi> and ſo backward? For ſuppoſing they ſhall live again, and die again; if they can merit, they can alſo ſinne whileſt they live among men: and ſo, when they die, and have their reward in heaven, this ſhall be no ſmall part of it,
<note n="p" place="margin">Non poſſe peccare.</note> 
                  <hi>To have no power to ſinne.</hi> But this opinion ſomewhat reſembleth the diverſified eſtate of devils, who <hi>ſhall be ſaved after the generall judgement,</hi> as Origen feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fabled; and which the Church hath branded for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>

                  <hi>Enoch and Elias were tranſlated: nor is their death recorded, or known; it being adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they are kept and preſerved that they may die hereafter, and by their bloud overthrow and extinguiſh Antichriſt,</hi> as Baronius cites him.

That the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are the two Teſtaments, as Beda, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius, Auguſtinus, and Ticonius are Authours. S. Hilarius rejecteth Enoch, and puts Moſes in his room, and that very peremptorily: <hi>Though many have ſubſtituted Jeremie in Enochs room,</hi> ſaith Hilarie on Matth. Can. 20. S. Hierom, the next Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cited by Bellarmine, is not conſtant enough for Elias (which I touched at before:) and Rupertus, on Malach. 4. te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth ſo much of Hierom: and Bullinger, <hi>in Apocal. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3. ſaith, <hi>S.

John the Divine: and indeed he is more likely to be one of the witneſſes, then Enoch; for unto him it was ſaid, Revel. 10.11. <hi>Thou muſt propheſie again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings:</hi> but no ſuch thing was ſaid to Enoch.

<note n="l" place="margin">Qui non expolientur corpore, ſed ſuperindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur immortalitate, ut abſorbeatur mortale à vita.</note> who ſhall not die corporally, but be clothed over with immortalitie, that mortalitie may be ſwallowed up of life; then to this opinion, without doubt, is agreeable that which in our Belief we confeſſe, That Chriſt ſhall come to judge both quick and dead.</hi> So farre proceedeth that holy Father S. Auguſtine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And becauſe he hath named a ſecond place, and inſtanceth in the Creed; it ſhall be my ſecond argument; and thus do I ſhape it; The Creed Apoſtolicall ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſhall judge both the quick and the dead. He was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead,</hi> ſaith S. Peter, Act. 10.42. S. Paul hath the ſame, 2. Timoth. 4.1. <hi>Teſtificor coram Jeſu Chriſto, qui judicatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus eſt vivos &amp; mortuos, I teſtifie before Jeſus Chriſt who ſhall judge the quick and the dead;</hi> And when the Scriptures ſay ſo, <hi>they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it
<note n="a" place="margin">De noviſſimo generali judicio.</note> of the laſt generall judgement,</hi> ſaith Bellarm. <hi>de Purgat.</hi> 2.4. Yea the Apoſtle expreſſeth ſo much in the laſt cited verſe of Timothie; <hi>Chriſt ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and his Kingdome.</hi> But his Kingdome was not of this world, and his firſt appearing was paſt; Therefore it muſt be at his ſecond coming. The ground-work of the words being laid, thus the ſtructure ariſeth. By the word, <hi>dead;</hi> you cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the parties as they are dead; for ſo Chriſt judgeth them not; alive people are the object of his judgement: But you muſt needs expound <hi>dead</hi> for thoſe, that ſometimes did die and now are raiſed to be judged, and are alive. The word <hi>quick,</hi> or <hi>living,</hi> you cannot interpret, as the Papiſts do, <hi>ſuch as are alive then, and ſhall die; and then be raiſed; and then be judged:</hi> for it needed not to have been ſaid, <hi>He ſhall judge the quick and the dead;</hi> but it had been ſufficient to have ſaid onely one of them, <hi>He ſhall judge the quick,</hi> or <hi>the living;</hi> for indeed they ſhall all be alive: or, <hi>He ſhall judge the dead;</hi> for even the living, and the quick ſhall die, as the Papiſts feigne. But indeed the Holy Writ divides all mankinde into two ſorts: the one part ſhall be living, and not die, but be changed; the other are ſuch, as ſometimes died: <hi>Viventes, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos.</hi> And thus there are no clouds in that article, <hi>He ſhall judge the quick and the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:6913:234"/>
               <p>In the Creed there is neither redundancie, nor defect: in the Popiſh expoſition there is redundancie: for, if all and every one ſhall die, it might as well have been expreſſed, <hi>He ſhall judge the dead:</hi> Or, if the dead, as dead, be not properly judged; it might onely have been ſaid, <hi>He ſhall judge the quick:</hi> for, according to the Papiſts, all the living ſhall die, and be again made quick. But, as I ſaid, the ſpecializing of two ſorts, <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> evinceth, that ſome ſhall not die, and ſome have died.</p>
               <p>Theſe words of the Creed did much move Cajetan, as himſelf confeſſeth; and they are brought by S.

But by this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Metaphorically, is the bodie meant, which ſhall not be caſt off from the ſoul, or the ſoul from it; but in the change ſhall be arayed with immortalitie.</p>
               <p>Now if there be not an expoliation, if there be not a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul from the bodie; there is no death: But there is no ſuch expoliation: therefore they who have other clothing put upon them, ſhall not die.

               <p>Lorinus on Act. 10. and Juſtinian upon theſe paſſages of S.

                  <hi>If Adam had not ſinned, his ſoul had never been diſunited from his bodie, but he had been clothed upon with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, and incorruption: ſo that the mortall part ſhould have been ſwallowed up of life, that is, ſhould be changed from a carnall life into a ſpirituall.</hi> Otherwhere S.

Why therefore may not they, that ſhall be <hi>reſidui, left,</hi> be alſo without death tranſlated into glorie? If the Jeſuits had had ſuch an argument, they would have ſaid, It were convenient for God ſo to do it, yea neceſſarie; that by plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration mankinde might ſee and know, what eſtate they had, and what eſtate ſometimes they loſt in Adam; and that all mankinde ſhould have been ſo tranſlated, if ſinne had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and thruſt death among us. I will onely ſay, It may be, that ſome are therefore kept to be tranſlated, to ſhew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Adam without death ſhould have been changed.</p>
               <p>Salmeron objecteth, <hi>Children found alive at that time, if they die not, ſhall continue in the ſame ſtature: which may not be beleeved.</hi> I anſwer, he derogateth from the power of God: as if he were not able to make <hi>children</hi> to be <hi>men</hi> by the <hi>change,</hi> as he is able by <hi>death.</hi> Can God make <hi>children</hi> of <hi>ſtones?</hi> and can he not make <hi>men</hi> of <hi>children?</hi> Did he create Adam to be a full grown man, of earth? and will his hand be ſhortned in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation? God, out of the little duſt of little children, raiſeth up, by Salmerons confeſſion, intire, perfect bodies of men: therefore the ſame God may as well, as eaſily, and perhaps more eaſily, (if God doth ſuch things more eaſily, then other) of the ſame living bodies of little children, by that myſterious change, produce and ampliate every member to the full growth of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men. God cauſed the rod of Aaron to bud; <hi>and it brought forth buds, and bloomed bloſſomes, and yeelded almonds,</hi> Numb. 17.8. and yet it was ſevered from the root; and laid up in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, before the teſtimonie; free from water, or earth, to nouriſh it: and this was done the morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was there laid: though it would not have born almonds, if it had been ſtill united to the ſtock; perhaps, for many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after. Did the ſame God reſtore unto Jeroboam, his hand which was dried up before, <hi>ſo that he could not pull it back to him again,</hi> 1.

And ſince they die the ſecond death; it mattereth not, if they avoid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt death, by immutation; or the fire of conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſtly, if they ſhall meet Chriſt in the aire, it is to their greater terrour: They ſhall be hurried to their judge, and haled toward their puniſhment: they meet him not, as he is <hi>a milde Saviour;</hi> but as <hi>an angrie and juſt God.</hi> And this is a ſufficient anſwer both to the ſecond and third objection of Salmeron; as the learned, who reade him, can teſtifie.</p>

Lect. confeſſeth, that our Greek reading is in ſenſe conſonant to that which the Apoſtle wrote to the Theſſalonians, the firſt Epiſt. 4 chap. and 17 verſe. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſweetly expound Scripture: <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle here: and to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>We which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together.</hi> The very Prefaces have a correſpondence in ſubſtance, and are more then ordinarie; <hi>This we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord,</hi> 1. Theſſal. 4.15. and here, 1. Corinth. 15.51. <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a myſterie:</hi> And then doth he in both places evince an immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without death. Therefore there can be no danger in our opinion; as may be evinced from Aquinas his free acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yea, there is not onely no danger, but great reaſon for it: for, How excellently doth this agree with that, which preſently followeth, verſe 52. <hi>The dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed.</hi> Doth he not plainly diſcriminate and diverſifie thoſe, which ſhall be <hi>raiſed,</hi> from thoſe which ſhall be <hi>changed?</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>We ſhall be raiſed incorruptible,</hi> and, <hi>We ſhall be changed;</hi> as he muſt have done, if all are to die, and then to be changed: And, to ſhew that the change is not by laying down
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:6913:236"/>of the bodie, he addeth immediately, <hi>This corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortalitie,</hi> verſ. 53. phraſes implying no <hi>loſſe,</hi> no <hi>decay,</hi> no <hi>ſeparation;</hi> but a <hi>ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> and <hi>ſuperaddition</hi> to what before was enjoyed. And when this is done, he ſaith moſt pertinently, verſ. 54. <hi>Then ſhall be brought to paſſe the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victorie.</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>When both theſe things are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the raiſing of the dead, and the change of the living, ſo that they ſhall be no more mortall; then ſhall death be overcome: O DEATH, WHERE IS THY STING?</hi> verſ. 55.</p>

Neither indeed doth the reading ſtand with ſenſe. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſolemnly premizeth, <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a myſterie:</hi> and then ſubjoyneth immediately, according to this new-fangled miſ-writing, <hi>We ſhall all therefore ſleep,</hi> or <hi>die.</hi> Is this a myſterie, that all ſhall ſleep, or all die? Doth he promiſe <hi>mountains,</hi> and bring forth a <hi>molehill?</hi> Every Heathen knows, that we ſhall die; every Chriſtian, Turk, and Jew, that we ſhall be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I thus argue: That death (if ſuch a death there be any) which is ſo ſpeedily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, by ſeparation of the ſoul from the bodie, and ended (as I may ſo ſay) by the ſwift and momentanie reuniting of the ſame ſoul to the ſame bodie, cannot handſomely be called a <hi>ſleep.</hi> Doth he ſleep, who in the twinkling of an eye is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from mortalitie to immortalitie? yea, from being alive, is made dead? and from being dead, is made alive; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibly? Was ever ſleep confined to an inſtant, till now? or may one be ſaid to ſleep, in the midſt of theſe great works? It is not ſo much as Analogicall ſleep. The greateſt ſleepers have more then an inſtant, ere they can begin to ſleep. Sleep
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:6913:236"/>creepeth or falleth on men by degrees; heavineſſe and dulneſſe uſher it; and the ſpirits have a time to retire to their forts, and cittadels; the ſenſes are not locked up, nor do they depoſite the uſe of their faculties in a moment. And may that be called properly <hi>reſt,</hi> or <hi>ſleep,</hi> which reſteth not above an inſtant, and is as quick as thought? Reſt and ſleep do couch upon the bed of time: likewiſe it is as much as poſſibly can be done, (if ſo much can be done) to awake one in an inſtant. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſeth the phraſe of <hi>ſleeping</hi> towards them, who reſt (as it were) in death, in the earth, in the grave: <hi>Our friend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus ſleepeth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, John 11.11. when indeed he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake,</hi> Dan. 12.2. Let one place of holy Writ be produced, where one and the ſame inſtant beginneth ſleep, and endeth awaking; and then I may ſay, there may be ſome ſhadow for that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But here is no pauſe, no reſt, no quiet; therefore no ſleep: therefore the word <hi>ſleep</hi> in this place, is applied to ſuch as died before; and not to ſuch as are alive, and ſhall die; as the ſecond lection implieth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it wanteth force, to ſay in the whole conjoyned ſentence, <hi>We ſhall therefore all ſleep,</hi> or <hi>die; but we ſhall all be changed.</hi> If the Apoſtle had intended any ſuch thing, he would not have uſed the adverſative particle <hi>But;</hi> but the implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive word <hi>And: We ſhall all therefore ſleep; AND we ſhall all be changed.</hi> This had been ſenſe, if thus it had been: but not being ſo, we may the more confidently ſhake off the ſecond lection, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as abhorrent from reaſon; and cleave to the firſt, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Omnes quidem non dormie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c. All we ſhall not die, but all we ſhall be changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo, from the varietie of Greek copies, I come to the Vulgat, the Tranſlation in Latine, <hi>Omnes quidem reſurgemus, ſed non omnes immutabimur; Truely we ſhall all of us ariſe, but we ſhall not all of us be changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, this differeth from all Greek copies; whereas, if it had been according to any ſort of them, it might have ſwayed us much that way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſame argument toucht at before, may alſo give a ſide-blow to this tranſlation. The Apoſtle raiſeth up their conſiderations, by promiſing to tell them a myſterie: But it was no myſterie to tell them, that they ſhould all be raiſed; when he had told it ſo pithily, ſo divinely, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beat upon it before, by ſo many kindes of arguments, as he did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where the Vulgat ſaith, <hi>Non omnes immutabimur;</hi> it is not true: for <hi>Omnes immutabimur, We ſhall all be changed,</hi> from <hi>mortalitie</hi> to <hi>immortalitie,</hi> from <hi>naturall bodies</hi> to <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> If you ſay, We ſhall not be all changed to glorie; I ſay ſo
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:6913:237"/>with you: I adde, That is no myſterie; all know that. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of a change to glorie eternall in the heavens; whereunto ſome onely ſhall be changed; but he ſpeaketh of a change from <hi>mortalitie</hi> to <hi>immortalitie,</hi> from <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible bodies</hi> to <hi>incorruptible;</hi> which even the wickedeſt men ſhall have. And perhaps he meaneth, that this generall immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhall be made, <hi>ſine media morte, without intercurrent,</hi> or <hi>intercedent death,</hi> even in the wicked that ſhall be then alive: yet in the change, you muſt alwaies make this diverſitie: The wicked ſhall be ſingled out to ſhame, to loſſe, to puniſhment eternall, with their raiſed or changed bodies (for even in their raiſing alſo, there is a change from corruption to incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:) but in the change of the godly, there is glorious incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, joyfull immortalitie, pleaſurable eternitie.</p>
               <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth a change of a thing from place to place; as when we take a piece of wood from the earth, and caſt it into the water: Thus the wicked ſhall be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from their graves to the judgement ſeat; and ſhall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the left hand of our Saviour; and, after ſentence, ſhall be haled, and caſt from earth into hell. On the other ſide, the righteous in their change ſhall be mounted up from their graves, or from the earth, into the aire, to meet Chriſt; and ſhall be at his right hand; and, after ſentence, be carried or aſcend up into heaven, in moſt glorious manner, to live with Chriſt eternally.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we reade it with the Vulgat, <hi>We ſhall all ariſe, but we ſhall not all be changed;</hi> we muſt alſo immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the words, <hi>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eie, at the laſt trump:</hi> for there is the pauſe, and ſtay to be made; there is the full ſentence. The Vulgat hath done very ill, to make the ſtay and full point at <hi>immutabimur:</hi> for then the words following bear no conſtruction at all, if they be conſidered by themſelves; <hi>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eie, at the laſt trump.</hi> For then cometh in new matter; <hi>For the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed: For this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, &amp;c.</hi> What coherence ſubſequent then ſhall you make unto theſe words? None at all. The coherence muſt be with the antecedent words. But, ſay I, take the antecedent words, as the Vulgat hath them; and reade, as you muſt, the connexion in this ſort, <hi>We ſhall indeed all ariſe: but ſhall not all be changed, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump: For the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſound, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, even in this reading there is little ſenſe alſo; yea, much untruth. Is it not certain that we ſhall be changed in a moment? Or how long ſhall the time of change be? There is no way to avoid this foul abſurditie, which cometh by the Vulgat edition; unleſſe it be by a greater, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:6913:237"/>is, by ſaying that you will make an Hyperbaton; and include theſe words, <hi>We ſhall not all be changed,</hi> in a Parentheſis: and then the ſenſe will be, <hi>We ſhall ariſe in a moment, &amp;c.</hi> For, though it be true, that we ſhall ariſe in a moment; yet there is no ground, that we ſhall not be changed in a moment. In all likelihood, a change may rather be more ſpeedie, which is without death; then that change which is made through death and reſurrection. If they may be, and ſhall be raiſed, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a moment; they may in a moment be changed, and not raiſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no authoritie, that I know, runneth for ſuch a needleſſe Parentheſis: and I deem it as a violence offered to the Text, ſo to ſtrain it, when the ſenſe will runne fairly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, according to the beſt Greek copies; <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep; but we ſhall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let this alſo ſerve to have been ſpoken againſt the Latin Vulgat edition, and its bad reading, <hi>Omnes quidem reſurgemus: ſed non omnes immutabimur. In momento, in ictu oculi, in noviſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma tuba, canet enim tuba, &amp; mortui reſurgent incorrupti, &amp;c.</hi> By how much the leſſe ſenſe is in this; by ſo much the more are we bound to adhere to the Originall, and the moſt common and beſt copies of it.</p>
               <p>This I may be bold to averre, That if ſome ſhall not die, and yet be changed; there ſhall be an infallible, yea demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative proof unto ſenſe, That the very ſelf ſame bodie which man had, ſhall inherit eternall glorie. For, if they die not, they muſt needs keep and have the ſame bodies, from which they are not parted by immutation. Yea, the identicall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame very bodies which were dead, may thus farre be proved, That if the <hi>changed bodies</hi> ſhall be ſtill the ſame in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> though differing in <hi>qualities;</hi> the <hi>raiſed bodies</hi> alſo ſhall be no otherwiſe, nor any way different: and Pythagoras will then diſprove his

<note n="n" place="margin">Hujus gratiae privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium illos manet, qui ab adventu Domini, deprehendentur in carne: &amp;, propter du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritias temporum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſti, merebuntur, compendio mortis per demutationem expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae, concurrere cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgentibus.</note> This gracious priviledge belongs unto thoſe, who at the coming of our Lord and Saviour to judgement ſhall be found alive upon earth: and for the grievous afflictions and preſſures of the times under Antichriſt they ſhall have granted unto them this indulgence, That they ſhall not die, but ſhall be ſuddenly changed, and ſo go to meet Chriſt together with thoſe which ſhall then be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Salmeron being peremptorie, That all and every one ſhall die properly, upon 1. Theſſal. 4. hath a wilde crotchet, That all, who ſhall be alive toward the end of the world, ſhall be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the fire of conflagration, which ſhall go before Chriſt; and ſo dead and raiſed ſhall be ſnatched up. But S. Auguſtine, <hi>de Civitat. Dei,</hi> 20.16. ſetting down the order of the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith, <hi>The fire of conflagration ſhall be after the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will cloſe this point, with the ſound and learned words of Calvin, (which fully accord, with what I reſted on, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this chapter) upon 1. Corinth. 15.
<note n="o" place="margin">Cùm mutatio fieri ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queat, quin aboleatur prior natura; ipſa muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio meritò cenſetur ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies mortis: ſed cùm non ſit animae à corpore ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, non reputatur in morte ordinaria.</note> 
                  <hi>Since there cannot be a change</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>but the former nature muſt be aboliſhed; the very change, on good grounds, may juſtly be accounted a kinde of death: but ſince there is not a ſeparation of the ſoul from the bodie, it is not to be reputed as if it were the common and ordinarie death.</hi> Upon 1. Theſſal. 4. he wittily obſerveth, that they
<note n="p" place="margin">Qui dormiunt, aliquo temporis ſpatio exuunt corporis ſubſtantiam; qui innovabuntur, non niſi qualitatem.</note> 
                  <hi>who are dead, or do die, for ſome ſpace of time or other (longer or ſhorter) their ſouls put off the ſubſtantiall clothing of the bodie or fleſh: but they who ſhall be changed, ſhall put off onely the qualitie, not the ſubſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumme of all is this, The third main queſtion, by me at firſt propounded, was, Whether all and every one, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, muſt and ſhall die? The Papiſts are obſtinate for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; I have proved the negative, That ſome may be, ſome have been, and ſome others ſhall be excepted, and not die. And ſo I end my third and laſt Chapter of my third book of Miſcellanies.</p>
